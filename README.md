# Lovecraft
This is a simple binary that will print random paragraphs from Lovecrafts stories. This repository also serves as an archive for H.P. Lovecrafts stories.

The stories are downloaded from https://hplovecraft.com/ via `scraper.rb`, and stored in this repository under the `library` folder. This currently includes 3 slightly different formats. 

Both the binary and all stories are packaged in the AUR:

```
yay -S lovecraft
