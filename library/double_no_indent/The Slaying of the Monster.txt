Great was the clamour in Laen; for smoke had been spied in the Hills of the Dragon. That surelymeant the Stirrings of the Monster—the Monster who spat lava and shook the earth as hewrithed in its depths. And when the men of Laen spoke together they swore to slay the Monster andkeep his fiery breath from searing their minaret-studded city and toppling their alabasterdomes.

So it was that by torch-light gathered fully a hundred of the little people,prepared to battle the Evil One in his hidden fast-hold. With the coming of night they beganmarching in ragged columns into the foot-hills beneath the fulgent lunar rays. Ahead a burningcloud shone clearly through the purple dusk, a guide to their goal.

For the sake of truth it is to be recorded that their spirits sank low long erethey sighted the foe, and as the moon grew dim and the coming of the dawn was heralded by gaudyclouds they wished themselves more than ever at home, dragon or no dragon. But as the sun rose theycheered up slightly, and shifting their spears, resolutely trudged the remaining distance.

Clouds of sulphurous smoke hung pall-like over the world, darkening even thenew-risen sun, and always replenished by sullen puffs from the mouth of the Monster. Little tonguesof hungry flame made the Laenians move swiftly over the hot stones. “But where is thedragon??” whispered one—fearfully and hoping it would not accept the query as aninvitation. In vain they looked—there was nothing solid enough to slay.

So shouldering their weapons, they wearily returned home and there set up a stonetablet graven to this effect—“BEING TROUBLED BY A FIERCE MONSTER THE BRAVE CITIZENS OFLAEN DID SET UPON IT AND SLAY IT IN ITS FEARFUL LAIR SAVING THE LAND FROM A DREADFULDOOM.”

These words were hard to read when we dug that stone from its deep, ancient layersof encrusting lava.
