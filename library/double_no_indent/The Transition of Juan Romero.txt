Of the events which took place at the Norton Mine on October 18th and 19th,1894, I have no desire to speak. A sense of duty to science is all that impels me to recall,in these last years of my life, scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute becauseI cannot wholly define it. But I believe that before I die I should tell what I know of the—shallI say transition—of Juan Romero.

My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy it isbetter that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates to the States or the Colonies,he leaves his past behind him. Besides, what I once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative;save perhaps the fact that during my service in India I was more at home amongst white-beardednative teachers than amongst my brother-officers. I had delved not a little into odd Easternlore when overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in America’s vastWest—a life wherein I found it well to accept a name—my present one—whichis very common and carries no meaning.

In the summer and autumn of 1894 I dwelt in the drear expanses of the CactusMountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated Norton Mine; whose discovery by anaged prospector some years before had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopledwaste to a seething cauldron of sordid life. A cavern of gold, lying deep below a mountain lake,had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest dreams, and now formed the seat of extensivetunnelling operations on the part of the corporation to which it had finally been sold. Additionalgrottoes had been found, and the yield of yellow metal was exceedingly great; so that a mightyand heterogeneous army of miners toiled day and night in the numerous passages and rock hollows.The Superintendent, a Mr. Arthur, often discussed the singularity of the local geological formations;speculating on the probable extent of the chain of caves, and estimating the future of the titanicmining enterprise. He considered the auriferous cavities the result of the action of water,and believed the last of them would soon be opened.

It was not long after my arrival and employment that Juan Romero came to theNorton Mine. One of a large herd of unkempt Mexicans attracted thither from the neighbouringcountry, he at first commanded attention only because of his features; which though plainlyof the Red Indian type, were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined conformation,being vastly unlike those of the average “Greaser” or Piute of the locality. Itis curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of Hispanicised and tribal Indians,Romero gave not the least impression of Caucasian blood. It was not the Castilian conquistadoror the American pioneer, but the ancient and noble Aztec, whom imagination called to view whenthe silent peon would rise in the early morning and gaze in fascination at the sun as it creptabove the eastern hills, meanwhile stretching out his arms to the orb as if in the performanceof some rite whose nature he did not himself comprehend. But save for his face, Romero was notin any way suggestive of nobility. Ignorant and dirty, he was at home amongst the other brown-skinnedMexicans; having come (so I was afterward told) from the very lowest sort of surroundings. Hehad been found as a child in a crude mountain hut, the only survivor of an epidemic which hadstalked lethally by. Near the hut, close to a rather unusual rock fissure, had lain two skeletons,newly picked by vultures, and presumably forming the sole remains of his parents. No one recalledtheir identity, and they were soon forgotten by the many. Indeed, the crumbling of the adobehut and the closing of the rock fissure by a subsequent avalanche had helped to efface eventhe scene from recollection. Reared by a Mexican cattle-thief who had given him his name, Juandiffered little from his fellows.

The attachment which Romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly commencedthrough the quaint and ancient Hindoo ring which I wore when not engaged in active labour. Ofits nature, and manner of coming into my possession, I cannot speak. It was my last link witha chapter of life forever closed, and I valued it highly. Soon I observed that the odd-lookingMexican was likewise interested; eyeing it with an expression that banished all suspicion ofmere covetousness. Its hoary hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection in his untutoredbut active mind, though he could not possibly have beheld their like before. Within a few weeksafter his advent, Romero was like a faithful servant to me; this notwithstanding the fact thatI was myself but an ordinary miner. Our conversation was necessarily limited. He knew but afew words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from thepatois of the peon of New Spain.

The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions. Thoughthe man Romero had interested me, and though my ring had affected him peculiarly, I think thatneither of us had any expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off. Geologicalconsiderations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest partof the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would beencountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite. With this work Romeroand I were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came fromothers. The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entiremountain. Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock, whilst minersthroughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet. Jewel Lake, which lay above thescene of action, heaved as in a tempest. Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawnedindefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathomit, nor any lamp illuminate it. Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent,who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered without cessationtill a bottom might be discovered.

Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of theirfailure. Firmly though respectfully they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm, or indeedto work further in the mine until it might be sealed. Something beyond their experience wasevidently confronting them, for so far as they could ascertain, the void below was infinite.The Superintendent did not reproach them. Instead, he pondered deeply, and made many plans forthe following day. The night shift did not go on that evening.

At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally.From somewhere within the works a dog barked in answer; either to the coyote—or to somethingelse. A storm was gathering around the peaks of the range, and weirdly shaped clouds scuddedhorribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous moon’s attemptsto shine through many layers of cirro-stratus vapours. It was Romero’s voice, coming fromthe bunk above, that awakened me; a voice excited and tense with some vague expectation I couldnot understand:

“¡Madre de Dios!—el sonido—ese sonido—¡oigaVd! ¿lo oye Vd?—Señor, THAT SOUND!”

I listened, wondering what sound he meant. The coyote, the dog, the storm,all were audible; the last named now gaining ascendancy as the wind shrieked more and more frantically.Flashes of lightning were visible through the bunk-house window. I questioned the nervous Mexican,repeating the sounds I had heard:

“¿El coyote?—¿el perro?—¿el viento?”

But Romero did not reply. Then he commenced whispering as in awe:

“El ritmo, Señor—el ritmo de la tierra—THATTHROB DOWN IN THE GROUND!”

And now I also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why. Deep, deep,below me was a sound—a rhythm, just as the peon had said—which, though exceedinglyfaint, yet dominated even the dog, the coyote, and the increasing tempest. To seek to describeit were useless—for it was such that no description is possible. Perhaps it was like thepulsing of the engines far down in a great liner, as sensed from the deck, yet it was not somechanical; not so devoid of the element of life and consciousness. Of all its qualities, remoteness in the earth most impressed me. To my mind rushed fragments of a passage in JosephGlanvill which Poe has quoted with tremendous effect—

“—the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works,which have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.”Suddenly Romero leaped from his bunk; pausing before me to gaze at the strangering on my hand, which glistened queerly in every flash of lightning, and then staring intentlyin the direction of the mine shaft. I also rose, and both stood motionless for a time, strainingour ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take on a vital quality. Then withoutapparent volition we began to move toward the door, whose rattling in the gale held a comfortingsuggestion of earthly reality. The chanting in the depths—for such the sound now seemedto be—grew in volume and distinctness; and we felt irresistibly urged out into the stormand thence to the gaping blackness of the shaft.

We encountered no living creature, for the men of the night shift had beenreleased from duty, and were doubtless at the Dry Gulch settlement pouring sinister rumoursinto the ear of some drowsy bartender. From the watchman’s cabin, however, gleamed a smallsquare of yellow light like a guardian eye. I dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affectedthe watchman; but Romero was moving more swiftly now, and I followed without pausing.

As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite. Itstruck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting ofmany voices. I have, as you are aware, been much in India. Romero and I moved without materialhesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever witha pitifully helpless fear and reluctance. At one time I fancied I had gone mad—this waswhen, on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle, I realised thatthe ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid lustre throughthe damp, heavy air around.

It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many rudeladders, broke into a run and left me alone. Some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting,perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in startling fashion; and with a wild outcryhe forged ahead unguided in the cavern’s gloom. I heard his repeated shrieks before me,as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders.And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of perception to note that his speech, when articulate,was not of any sort known to me. Harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customarymixture of bad Spanish and worse English, and of these only the oft repeated cry “Huitzilopotchli”seemed in the least familiar. Later I definitely placed that word in the works of a great historian—andshuddered when the association came to me.

The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief, beginning justas I reached the final cavern of the journey. Out of the darkness immediately ahead burst afinal shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I couldnever hear again and survive. In that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrositiesof earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race. Simultaneously thelight from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower space but afew yards ahead of me. I had arrived at the abyss, which was now redly aglow, and which hadevidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero. Advancing, I peered over the edge of that chasmwhich no line could fathom, and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideousuproar. At first I beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity; but then shapes, all infinitelydistant, began to detach themselves from the confusion, and I saw—was it Juan Romero?—butGod! I dare not tell you what I saw!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some power from heaven, coming to myaid, obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when two universes collidein space. Chaos supervened, and I knew the peace of oblivion.

I hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved; butI will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent. WhenI awaked, I was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window. Some distanceaway the lifeless body of Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, includingthe camp doctor. The men were discussing the strange death of the Mexican as he lay asleep;a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had struckand shaken the mountain. No direct cause was evident, and an autopsy failed to shew any reasonwhy Romero should not be living. Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neitherRomero nor I had left the bunkhouse during the night; that neither had been awake during thefrightful storm which had passed over the Cactus range. That storm, said men who had ventureddown the mine shaft, had caused extensive caving in, and had completely closed the deep abysswhich had created so much apprehension the day before. When I asked the watchman what soundshe had heard prior to the mighty thunderbolt, he mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the snarlingmountain wind—nothing more. Nor do I doubt his word.

Upon the resumption of work Superintendent Arthur called on some especiallydependable men to make a few investigations around the spot where the gulf had appeared. Thoughhardly eager, they obeyed; and a deep boring was made. Results were very curious. The roof ofthe void, as seen whilst it was open, was not by any means thick; yet now the drills of theinvestigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock. Finding nothing else,not even gold, the Superintendent abandoned his attempts; but a perplexed look occasionallysteals over his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk.

One other thing is curious. Shortly after waking on that morning after thestorm, I noticed the unaccountable absence of my Hindoo ring from my finger. I had prized itgreatly, yet nevertheless felt a sensation of relief at its disappearance. If one of my fellow-minersappropriated it, he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty, for despite advertisementsand a police search the ring was never seen again. Somehow I doubt if it was stolen by mortalhands, for many strange things were taught me in India.

My opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time. In broad daylight,and at most seasons I am apt to think the greater part of it a mere dream; but sometimes inthe autumn, about two in the morning when winds and animals howl dismally, there comes frominconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.and I feel that the transition of Juan Romero was a terrible one indeed.
