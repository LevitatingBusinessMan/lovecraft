I.

Bear in mind closely that I did not see any actual visual horror at the end. To say that a mentalshock was the cause of what I inferred—that last straw which sent me racing out of thelonely Akeley farmhouse and through the wild domed hills of Vermont in a commandeered motorat night—is to ignore the plainest facts of my final experience. Notwithstanding the deepextent to which I shared the information and speculations of Henry Akeley, the things I sawand heard, and the admitted vividness of the impression produced on me by these things, I cannotprove even now whether I was right or wrong in my hideous inference. For after all, Akeley’sdisappearance establishes nothing. People found nothing amiss in his house despite the bullet-markson the outside and inside. It was just as though he had walked out casually for a ramble inthe hills and failed to return. There was not even a sign that a guest had been there, or thatthose horrible cylinders and machines had been stored in the study. That he had mortally fearedthe crowded green hills and endless trickle of brooks among which he had been born and reared,means nothing at all, either; for thousands are subject to just such morbid fears. Eccentricity,moreover, could easily account for his strange acts and apprehensions toward the last.
The whole matter began, so far as I am concerned, with the historic and unprecedentedVermont floods of November 3, 1927. I was then, as now, an instructor of literature at MiskatonicUniversity in Arkham, Massachusetts, and an enthusiastic amateur student of New England folklore.Shortly after the flood, amidst the varied reports of hardship, suffering, and organised reliefwhich filled the press, there appeared certain odd stories of things found floating in someof the swollen rivers; so that many of my friends embarked on curious discussions and appealedto me to shed what light I could on the subject. I felt flattered at having my folklore studytaken so seriously, and did what I could to belittle the wild, vague tales which seemed so clearlyan outgrowth of old rustic superstitions. It amused me to find several persons of educationwho insisted that some stratum of obscure, distorted fact might underlie the rumours.
The tales thus brought to my notice came mostly through newspaper cuttings;though one yarn had an oral source and was repeated to a friend of mine in a letter from hismother in Hardwick, Vermont. The type of thing described was essentially the same in all cases,though there seemed to be three separate instances involved—one connected with the WinooskiRiver near Montpelier, another attached to the West River in Windham County beyond Newfane,and a third centring in the Passumpsic in Caledonia County above Lyndonville. Of course manyof the stray items mentioned other instances, but on analysis they all seemed to boil down tothese three. In each case country folk reported seeing one or more very bizarre and disturbingobjects in the surging waters that poured down from the unfrequented hills, and there was awidespread tendency to connect these sights with a primitive, half-forgotten cycle of whisperedlegend which old people resurrected for the occasion.
What people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like any they hadever seen before. Naturally, there were many human bodies washed along by the streams in thattragic period; but those who described these strange shapes felt quite sure that they were nothuman, despite some superficial resemblances in size and general outline. Nor, said the witnesses,could they have been any kind of animal known to Vermont. They were pinkish things about fivefeet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings andseveral sets of articulated limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudesof very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be. It was really remarkable how closelythe reports from different sources tended to coincide; though the wonder was lessened by thefact that the old legends, shared at one time throughout the hill country, furnished a morbidlyvivid picture which might well have coloured the imaginations of all the witnesses concerned.It was my conclusion that such witnesses—in every case naive and simple backwoods folk—hadglimpsed the battered and bloated bodies of human beings or farm animals in the whirling currents;and had allowed the half-remembered folklore to invest these pitiful objects with fantasticattributes.
The ancient folklore, while cloudy, evasive, and largely forgotten by the presentgeneration, was of a highly singular character, and obviously reflected the influence of stillearlier Indian tales. I knew it well, though I had never been in Vermont, through the exceedinglyrare monograph of Eli Davenport, which embraces material orally obtained prior to 1839 amongthe oldest people of the state. This material, moreover, closely coincided with tales whichI had personally heard from elderly rustics in the mountains of New Hampshire. Briefly summarised,it hinted at a hidden race of monstrous beings which lurked somewhere among the remoter hills—inthe deep woods of the highest peaks, and the dark valleys where streams trickle from unknownsources. These beings were seldom glimpsed, but evidences of their presence were reported bythose who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of certain mountains or into certaindeep, steep-sided gorges that even the wolves shunned.
There were queer footprints or claw-prints in the mud of brook-margins andbarren patches, and curious circles of stones, with the grass around them worn away, which didnot seem to have been placed or entirely shaped by Nature. There were, too, certain caves ofproblematical depth in the sides of the hills; with mouths closed by boulders in a manner scarcelyaccidental, and with more than an average quota of the queer prints leading both toward andaway from them—if indeed the direction of these prints could be justly estimated. Andworst of all, there were the things which adventurous people had seen very rarely in the twilightof the remotest valleys and the dense perpendicular woods above the limits of normal hill-climbing.
It would have been less uncomfortable if the stray accounts of these thingshad not agreed so well. As it was, nearly all the rumours had several points in common; averringthat the creatures were a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with twogreat bat-like wings in the middle of the back. They sometimes walked on all their legs, andsometimes on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey large objects of indeterminatenature. On one occasion they were spied in considerable numbers, a detachment of them wadingalong a shallow woodland watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Oncea specimen was seen flying—launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at nightand vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been silhouetted an instant againstthe full moon.
These things seemed content, on the whole, to let mankind alone; though theywere at times held responsible for the disappearance of venturesome individuals—especiallypersons who built houses too close to certain valleys or too high up on certain mountains. Manylocalities came to be known as inadvisable to settle in, the feeling persisting long after thecause was forgotten. People would look up at some of the neighbouring mountain-precipices witha shudder, even when not recalling how many settlers had been lost, and how many farmhousesburnt to ashes, on the lower slopes of those grim, green sentinels.
But while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to haveharmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosityrespecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world. Therewere tales of the queer claw-prints seen around farmhouse windows in the morning, and of occasionaldisappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas. Tales, besides, of buzzing voicesin imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travellers on roads and cart-pathsin the deep woods, and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard wherethe primal forest pressed close upon their dooryards. In the final layer of legends—thelayer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with thedreaded places—there are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at someperiod of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change, and who were shunned andwhispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings. In one of the northeasterncounties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses ofbeing allies or representatives of the abhorred things.
As to what the things were—explanations naturally varied. The commonname applied to them was “those ones”, or “the old ones”, though otherterms had a local and transient use. Perhaps the bulk of the Puritan settlers set them downbluntly as familiars of the devil, and made them a basis of awed theological speculation. Thosewith Celtic legendry in their heritage—mainly the Scotch-Irish element of New Hampshire,and their kindred who had settled in Vermont on Governor Wentworth’s colonial grants—linkedthem vaguely with the malign fairies and “little people” of the bogs and raths,and protected themselves with scraps of incantation handed down through many generations. Butthe Indians had the most fantastic theories of all. While different tribal legends differed,there was a marked consensus of belief in certain vital particulars; it being unanimously agreedthat the creatures were not native to this earth.
The Pennacook myths, which were the most consistent and picturesque, taughtthat the Winged Ones came from the Great Bear in the sky, and had mines in our earthly hillswhence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other world. They did not live here,said the myths, but merely maintained outposts and flew back with vast cargoes of stone to theirown stars in the north. They harmed only those earth-people who got too near them or spied uponthem. Animals shunned them through instinctive hatred, not because of being hunted. They couldnot eat the things and animals of earth, but brought their own food from the stars. It was badto get near them, and sometimes young hunters who went into their hills never came back. Itwas not good, either, to listen to what they whispered at night in the forest with voices likea bee’s that tried to be like the voices of men. They knew the speech of all kinds ofmen—Pennacooks, Hurons, men of the Five Nations—but did not seem to have or needany speech of their own. They talked with their heads, which changed colour in different waysto mean different things.
All the legendry, of course, white and Indian alike, died down during the nineteenthcentury, except for occasional atavistical flareups. The ways of the Vermonters became settled;and once their habitual paths and dwellings were established according to a certain fixed plan,they remembered less and less what fears and avoidances had determined that plan, and even thatthere had been any fears or avoidances. Most people simply knew that certain hilly regions wereconsidered as highly unhealthy, unprofitable, and generally unlucky to live in, and that thefarther one kept from them the better off one usually was. In time the ruts of custom and economicinterest became so deeply cut in approved places that there was no longer any reason for goingoutside them, and the haunted hills were left deserted by accident rather than by design. Saveduring infrequent local scares, only wonder-loving grandmothers and retrospective nonagenariansever whispered of beings dwelling in those hills; and even such whisperers admitted that therewas not much to fear from those things now that they were used to the presence of houses andsettlements, and now that human beings let their chosen territory severely alone.
All this I had known from my reading, and from certain folk-tales picked upin New Hampshire; hence when the flood-time rumours began to appear, I could easily guess whatimaginative background had evolved them. I took great pains to explain this to my friends, andwas correspondingly amused when several contentious souls continued to insist on a possibleelement of truth in the reports. Such persons tried to point out that the early legends hada significant persistence and uniformity, and that the virtually unexplored nature of the Vermonthills made it unwise to be dogmatic about what might or might not dwell among them; nor couldthey be silenced by my assurance that all the myths were of a well-known pattern common to mostof mankind and determined by early phases of imaginative experience which always produced thesame type of delusion.
It was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the Vermont myths differedbut little in essence from those universal legends of natural personification which filled theancient world with fauns and dryads and satyrs, suggested the kallikanzari of modernGreece, and gave to wild Wales and Ireland their dark hints of strange, small, and terriblehidden races of troglodytes and burrowers. No use, either, to point out the even more startlinglysimilar belief of the Nepalese hill tribes in the dreaded Mi-Go or “AbominableSnow-Men” who lurk hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the Himalayan summits.When I brought up this evidence, my opponents turned it against me by claiming that it mustimply some actual historicity for the ancient tales; that it must argue the real existence ofsome queer elder earth-race, driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind, whichmight very conceivably have survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent times—oreven to the present.
The more I laughed at such theories, the more these stubborn friends asseveratedthem; adding that even without the heritage of legend the recent reports were too clear, consistent,detailed, and sanely prosaic in manner of telling, to be completely ignored. Two or three fanaticalextremists went so far as to hint at possible meanings in the ancient Indian tales which gavethe hidden beings a non-terrestrial origin; citing the extravagant books of Charles Fort withtheir claims that voyagers from other worlds and outer space have often visited earth. Mostof my foes, however, were merely romanticists who insisted on trying to transfer to real lifethe fantastic lore of lurking “little people” made popular by the magnificent horror-fictionof Arthur Machen.

II.

As was only natural under the circumstances, this piquant debating finallygot into print in the form of letters to the Arkham Advertiser; some of which were copiedin the press of those Vermont regions whence the flood-stories came. The Rutland Heraldgave half a page of extracts from the letters on both sides, while the Brattleboro Reformerreprinted one of my long historical and mythological summaries in full, with some accompanyingcomments in “The Pendrifter’s” thoughtful column which supported and applaudedmy sceptical conclusions. By the spring of 1928 I was almost a well-known figure in Vermont,notwithstanding the fact that I had never set foot in the state. Then came the challenging lettersfrom Henry Akeley which impressed me so profoundly, and which took me for the first and lasttime to that fascinating realm of crowded green precipices and muttering forest streams.
Most of what I now know of Henry Wentworth Akeley was gathered by correspondencewith his neighbours, and with his only son in California, after my experience in his lonelyfarmhouse. He was, I discovered, the last representative on his home soil of a long, locallydistinguished line of jurists, administrators, and gentlemen-agriculturists. In him, however,the family mentally had veered away from practical affairs to pure scholarship; so that he hadbeen a notable student of mathematics, astronomy, biology, anthropology, and folklore at theUniversity of Vermont. I had never previously heard of him, and he did not give many autobiographicaldetails in his communications; but from the first I saw he was a man of character, education,and intelligence, albeit a recluse with very little worldly sophistication.
Despite the incredible nature of what he claimed, I could not help at oncetaking Akeley more seriously than I had taken any of the other challengers of my views. Forone thing, he was really close to the actual phenomena—visible and tangible—thathe speculated so grotesquely about; and for another thing, he was amazingly willing to leavehis conclusions in a tentative state like a true man of science. He had no personal preferencesto advance, and was always guided by what he took to be solid evidence. Of course I began byconsidering him mistaken, but gave him credit for being intelligently mistaken; and at no timedid I emulate some of his friends in attributing his ideas, and his fear of the lonely greenhills, to insanity. I could see that there was a great deal to the man, and knew that what hereported must surely come from strange circumstances deserving investigation, however littleit might have to do with the fantastic causes he assigned. Later on I received from him certainmaterial proofs which placed the matter on a somewhat different and bewilderingly bizarre basis.
I cannot do better than transcribe in full, so far as is possible, the longletter in which Akeley introduced himself, and which formed such an important landmark in myown intellectual history. It is no longer in my possession, but my memory holds almost everyword of its portentous message; and again I affirm my confidence in the sanity of the man whowrote it. Here is the text—a text which reached me in the cramped, archaic-looking scrawlof one who had obviously not mingled much with the world during his sedate, scholarly life.
                  R.F.D. #2,
            Townshend, Windham Co.,
            Vermont
            May 5, 1928.         Albert N. Wilmarth, Esq.,
118 Saltonstall St.,
Arkham, Mass.,
My dear Sir:—
I have read with great interest the Brattleboro Reformer’s reprint (Apr. 23, ’28)of your letter on the recent stories of strange bodies seen floating in our flooded streamslast fall, and on the curious folklore they so well agree with. It is easy to see why an outlanderwould take the position you take, and even why “Pendrifter” agrees with you. Thatis the attitude generally taken by educated persons both in and out of Vermont, and was my ownattitude as a young man (I am now 57) before my studies, both general and in Davenport’sbook, led me to do some exploring in parts of the hills hereabouts not usually visited.
I was directed toward such studies by the queer old tales I used to hear fromelderly farmers of the more ignorant sort, but now I wish I had let the whole matter alone.I might say, with all proper modesty, that the subject of anthropology and folklore is by nomeans strange to me. I took a good deal of it at college, and am familiar with most of the standardauthorities such as Tylor, Lubbock, Frazer, Quatrefages, Murray, Osborn, Keith, Boule, G. ElliotSmith, and so on. It is no news to me that tales of hidden races are as old as all mankind.I have seen the reprints of letters from you, and those arguing with you, in the RutlandHerald, and guess I know about where your controversy stands at the present time.
What I desire to say now is, that I am afraid your adversaries are nearer rightthan yourself, even though all reason seems to be on your side. They are nearer right than theyrealise themselves—for of course they go only by theory, and cannot know what I know.If I knew as little of the matter as they, I would not feel justified in believing as they do.I would be wholly on your side.
You can see that I am having a hard time getting to the point, probably becauseI really dread getting to the point; but the upshot of the matter is that I have certainevidence that monstrous things do indeed live in the woods on the high hills which nobody visits.I have not seen any of the things floating in the rivers, as reported, but I have seen thingslike them under circumstances I dread to repeat. I have seen footprints, and of late haveseen them nearer my own home (I live in the old Akeley place south of Townshend Village, onthe side of Dark Mountain) than I dare tell you now. And I have overheard voices in the woodsat certain points that I will not even begin to describe on paper.
At one place I heard them so much that I took a phonograph there—witha dictaphone attachment and wax blank—and I shall try to arrange to have you hear therecord I got. I have run it on the machine for some of the old people up here, and one of thevoices had nearly scared them paralysed by reason of its likeness to a certain voice (that buzzingvoice in the woods which Davenport mentions) that their grandmothers have told about and mimickedfor them. I know what most people think of a man who tells about “hearing voices”—butbefore you draw conclusions just listen to this record and ask some of the older backwoods peoplewhat they think of it. If you can account for it normally, very well; but there must be somethingbehind it. Ex nihilo nihil fit, you know.
Now my object in writing you is not to start an argument, but to give you informationwhich I think a man of your tastes will find deeply interesting. This is private. PubliclyI am on your side, for certain things shew me that it does not do for people to know toomuch about these matters. My own studies are now wholly private, and I would not think of sayinganything to attract people’s attention and cause them to visit the places I have explored.It is true—terribly true—that there are non-human creatures watching us all thetime; with spies among us gathering information. It is from a wretched man who, if he wassane (as I think he was), was one of those spies, that I got a large part of my cluesto the matter. He later killed himself, but I have reason to think there are others now.
The things come from another planet, being able to live in interstellarspace and fly through it on clumsy, powerful wings which have a way of resisting the etherbut which are too poor at steering to be of much use in helping them about on earth. I willtell you about this later if you do not dismiss me at once as a madman. They come here to getmetals from mines that go deep under the hills, and I think I know where they come from.They will not hurt us if we let them alone, but no one can say what will happen if we get toocurious about them. Of course a good army of men could wipe out their mining colony. That iswhat they are afraid of. But if that happened, more would come from outside—anynumber of them. They could easily conquer the earth, but have not tried so far because theyhave not needed to. They would rather leave things as they are to save bother.
I think they mean to get rid of me because of what I have discovered. Thereis a great black stone with unknown hieroglyphics half worn away which I found in the woodson Round Hill, east of here; and after I took it home everything became different. If they thinkI suspect too much they will either kill me or take me off the earth to where they come from.They like to take away men of learning once in a while, to keep informed on the state of thingsin the human world.
This leads me to my secondary purpose in addressing you—namely, to urgeyou to hush up the present debate rather than give it more publicity. People must be keptaway from these hills, and in order to effect this, their curiosity ought not to be arousedany further. Heaven knows there is peril enough anyway, with promoters and real estate men floodingVermont with herds of summer people to overrun the wild places and cover the hills with cheapbungalows.
I shall welcome further communication with you, and shall try to send you thatphonograph record and black stone (which is so worn that photographs don’t shew much)by express if you are willing. I say “try” because I think those creatures havea way of tampering with things around here. There is a sullen, furtive fellow named Brown, ona farm near the village, who I think is their spy. Little by little they are trying to cut meoff from our world because I know too much about their world.
They have the most amazing way of finding out what I do. You may not even getthis letter. I think I shall have to leave this part of the country and go to live with my sonin San Diego, Cal., if things get any worse, but it is not easy to give up the place you wereborn in, and where your family has lived for six generations. Also, I would hardly dare sellthis house to anybody now that the creatures have taken notice of it. They seem to betrying to get the black stone back and destroy the phonograph record, but I shall not let themif I can help it. My great police dogs always hold them back, for there are very few here asyet, and they are clumsy in getting about. As I have said, their wings are not much use forshort flights on earth. I am on the very brink of deciphering that stone—in a very terribleway—and with your knowledge of folklore you may be able to supply missing links enoughto help me. I suppose you know all about the fearful myths antedating the coming of man to theearth—the Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu cycles—which are hinted at in the Necronomicon.I had access to a copy of that once, and hear that you have one in your college library underlock and key.
To conclude, Mr. Wilmarth, I think that with our respective studies we canbe very useful to each other. I don’t wish to put you in any peril, and suppose I oughtto warn you that possession of the stone and the record won’t be very safe; but I thinkyou will find any risks worth running for the sake of knowledge. I will drive down to Newfaneor Brattleboro to send whatever you authorise me to send, for the express offices there aremore to be trusted. I might say that I live quite alone now, since I can’t keep hiredhelp any more. They won’t stay because of the things that try to get near the house atnight, and that keep the dogs barking continually. I am glad I didn’t get as deep as thisinto the business while my wife was alive, for it would have driven her mad.
Hoping that I am not bothering you unduly, and that you will decide to getin touch with me rather than throw this letter into the waste basket as a madman’s raving,I am
Yrs. very truly,
HENRY W. AKELEYP.S. I am making some extra prints of certain photographs taken by me, which I think will helpto prove a number of the points I have touched on. The old people think they are monstrouslytrue. I shall send you these very soon if you are interested. H.W.A.It would be difficult to describe my sentiments upon reading this strange documentfor the first time. By all ordinary rules, I ought to have laughed more loudly at these extravagancesthan at the far milder theories which had previously moved me to mirth; yet something in thetone of the letter made me take it with paradoxical seriousness. Not that I believed for a momentin the hidden race from the stars which my correspondent spoke of; but that, after some gravepreliminary doubts, I grew to feel oddly sure of his sanity and sincerity, and of his confrontationby some genuine though singular and abnormal phenomenon which he could not explain except inthis imaginative way. It could not be as he thought it, I reflected, yet on the other hand itcould not be otherwise than worthy of investigation. The man seemed unduly excited and alarmedabout something, but it was hard to think that all cause was lacking. He was so specific andlogical in certain ways—and after all, his yarn did fit in so perplexingly well with someof the old myths—even the wildest Indian legends.
That he had really overheard disturbing voices in the hills, and had reallyfound the black stone he spoke about, was wholly possible despite the crazy inferences he hadmade—inferences probably suggested by the man who had claimed to be a spy of the outerbeings and had later killed himself. It was easy to deduce that this man must have been whollyinsane, but that he probably had a streak of perverse outward logic which made the naive Akeley—alreadyprepared for such things by his folklore studies—believe his tale. As for the latest developments—itappeared from his inability to keep hired help that Akeley’s humbler rustic neighbourswere as convinced as he that his house was besieged by uncanny things at night. The dogs reallybarked, too.
And then the matter of that phonograph record, which I could not but believehe had obtained in the way he said. It must mean something; whether animal noises deceptivelylike human speech, or the speech of some hidden, night-haunting human being decayed to a statenot much above that of lower animals. From this my thoughts went back to the black hieroglyphedstone, and to speculations upon what it might mean. Then, too, what of the photographs whichAkeley said he was about to send, and which the old people had found so convincingly terrible?
As I re-read the cramped handwriting I felt as never before that my credulousopponents might have more on their side than I had conceded. After all, there might be somequeer and perhaps hereditarily misshapen outcasts in those shunned hills, even though no suchrace of star-born monsters as folklore claimed. And if there were, then the presence of strangebodies in the flooded streams would not be wholly beyond belief. Was it too presumptuous tosuppose that both the old legends and the recent reports had this much of reality behind them?But even as I harboured these doubts I felt ashamed that so fantastic a piece of bizarrerieas Henry Akeley’s wild letter had brought them up.
In the end I answered Akeley’s letter, adopting a tone of friendly interestand soliciting further particulars. His reply came almost by return mail; and contained, trueto promise, a number of kodak views of scenes and objects illustrating what he had to tell.Glancing at these pictures as I took them from the envelope, I felt a curious sense of frightand nearness to forbidden things; for in spite of the vagueness of most of them, they had adamnably suggestive power which was intensified by the fact of their being genuine photographs—actualoptical links with what they portrayed, and the product of an impersonal transmitting processwithout prejudice, fallibility, or mendacity.
The more I looked at them, the more I saw that my serious estimate of Akeleyand his story had not been unjustified. Certainly, these pictures carried conclusive evidenceof something in the Vermont hills which was at least vastly outside the radius of our commonknowledge and belief. The worst thing of all was the footprint—a view taken where thesun shone on a mud patch somewhere in a deserted upland. This was no cheaply counterfeited thing,I could see at a glance; for the sharply defined pebbles and grass-blades in the field of visiongave a clear index of scale and left no possibility of a tricky double exposure. I have calledthe thing a “footprint”, but “claw-print” would be a better term. Evennow I can scarcely describe it save to say that it was hideously crab-like, and that there seemedto be some ambiguity about its direction. It was not a very deep or fresh print, but seemedto be about the size of an average man’s foot. From a central pad, pairs of saw-toothednippers projected in opposite directions—quite baffling as to function, if indeed thewhole object were exclusively an organ of locomotion.
Another photograph—evidently a time-exposure taken in deep shadow—wasof the mouth of a woodland cave, with a boulder of rounded regularity choking the aperture.On the bare ground in front of it one could just discern a dense network of curious tracks,and when I studied the picture with a magnifier I felt uneasily sure that the tracks were likethe one in the other view. A third picture shewed a druid-like circle of standing stones onthe summit of a wild hill. Around the cryptic circle the grass was very much beaten down andworn away, though I could not detect any footprints even with the glass. The extreme remotenessof the place was apparent from the veritable sea of tenantless mountains which formed the backgroundand stretched away toward a misty horizon.
But if the most disturbing of all the views was that of the footprint, themost curiously suggestive was that of the great black stone found in the Round Hill woods. Akeleyhad photographed it on what was evidently his study table, for I could see rows of books anda bust of Milton in the background. The thing, as nearly as one might guess, had faced the cameravertically with a somewhat irregularly curved surface of one by two feet; but to say anythingdefinite about that surface, or about the general shape of the whole mass, almost defies thepower of language. What outlandish geometrical principles had guided its cutting—for artificiallycut it surely was—I could not even begin to guess; and never before had I seen anythingwhich struck me as so strangely and unmistakably alien to this world. Of the hieroglyphics onthe surface I could discern very few, but one or two that I did see gave me rather a shock.Of course they might be fraudulent, for others besides myself had read the monstrous and abhorredNecronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; but it nevertheless made me shiver to recognisecertain ideographs which study had taught me to link with the most blood-curdling and blasphemouswhispers of things that had had a kind of mad half-existence before the earth and the otherinner worlds of the solar system were made.
Of the five remaining pictures, three were of swamp and hill scenes which seemedto bear traces of hidden and unwholesome tenancy. Another was of a queer mark in the groundvery near Akeley’s house, which he said he had photographed the morning after a nighton which the dogs had barked more violently than usual. It was very blurred, and one could reallydraw no certain conclusions from it; but it did seem fiendishly like that other mark or claw-printphotographed on the deserted upland. The final picture was of the Akeley place itself; a trimwhite house of two stories and attic, about a century and a quarter old, and with a well-keptlawn and stone-bordered path leading up to a tastefully carved Georgian doorway. There wereseveral huge police dogs on the lawn, squatting near a pleasant-faced man with a close-croppedgrey beard whom I took to be Akeley himself—his own photographer, one might infer fromthe tube-connected bulb in his right hand.
From the pictures I turned to the bulky, closely written letter itself; andfor the next three hours was immersed in a gulf of unutterable horror. Where Akeley had givenonly outlines before, he now entered into minute details; presenting long transcripts of wordsoverheard in the woods at night, long accounts of monstrous pinkish forms spied in thicketsat twilight on the hills, and a terrible cosmic narrative derived from the application of profoundand varied scholarship to the endless bygone discourses of the mad self-styled spy who had killedhimself. I found myself faced by names and terms that I had heard elsewhere in the most hideousof connexions—Yuggoth, Great Cthulhu, Tsathoggua, Yog-Sothoth, R’lyeh, Nyarlathotep,Azathoth, Hastur, Yian, Leng, the Lake of Hali, Bethmoora, the Yellow Sign, L’mur-Kathulos,Bran, and the Magnum Innominandum—and was drawn back through nameless aeons and inconceivabledimensions to worlds of elder, outer entity at which the crazed author of the Necronomiconhad only guessed in the vaguest way. I was told of the pits of primal life, and of the streamsthat had trickled down therefrom; and finally, of the tiny rivulet from one of those streamswhich had become entangled with the destinies of our own earth.
My brain whirled; and where before I had attempted to explain things away,I now began to believe in the most abnormal and incredible wonders. The array of vital evidencewas damnably vast and overwhelming; and the cool, scientific attitude of Akeley—an attituderemoved as far as imaginable from the demented, the fanatical, the hysterical, or even the extravagantlyspeculative—had a tremendous effect on my thought and judgment. By the time I laid thefrightful letter aside I could understand the fears he had come to entertain, and was readyto do anything in my power to keep people away from those wild, haunted hills. Even now, whentime has dulled the impression and made me half question my own experience and horrible doubts,there are things in that letter of Akeley’s which I would not quote, or even form intowords on paper. I am almost glad that the letter and record and photographs are gone now—andI wish, for reasons I shall soon make clear, that the new planet beyond Neptune had not beendiscovered.
With the reading of that letter my public debating about the Vermont horrorpermanently ended. Arguments from opponents remained unanswered or put off with promises, andeventually the controversy petered out into oblivion. During late May and June I was in constantcorrespondence with Akeley; though once in a while a letter would be lost, so that we wouldhave to retrace our ground and perform considerable laborious copying. What we were trying todo, as a whole, was to compare notes in matters of obscure mythological scholarship and arriveat a clearer correlation of the Vermont horrors with the general body of primitive world legend.
For one thing, we virtually decided that these morbidities and the hellishHimalayan Mi-Go were one and the same order of incarnated nightmare. There were alsoabsorbing zoölogical conjectures, which I would have referred to Professor Dexter in myown college but for Akeley’s imperative command to tell no one of the matter before us.If I seem to disobey that command now, it is only because I think that at this stage a warningabout those farther Vermont hills—and about those Himalayan peaks which bold explorersare more and more determined to ascend—is more conducive to public safety than silencewould be. One specific thing we were leading up to was a deciphering of the hieroglyphics onthat infamous black stone—a deciphering which might well place us in possession of secretsdeeper and more dizzying than any formerly known to man.

III.

Toward the end of June the phonograph record came—shipped from Brattleboro,since Akeley was unwilling to trust conditions on the branch line north of there. He had begunto feel an increased sense of espionage, aggravated by the loss of some of our letters; andsaid much about the insidious deeds of certain men whom he considered tools and agents of thehidden beings. Most of all he suspected the surly farmer Walter Brown, who lived alone on arun-down hillside place near the deep woods, and who was often seen loafing around corners inBrattleboro, Bellows Falls, Newfane, and South Londonderry in the most inexplicable and seeminglyunmotivated way. Brown’s voice, he felt convinced, was one of those he had overheard ona certain occasion in a very terrible conversation; and he had once found a footprint or claw-printnear Brown’s house which might possess the most ominous significance. It had been curiouslynear some of Brown’s own footprints—footprints that faced toward it.
So the record was shipped from Brattleboro, whither Akeley drove in his Fordcar along the lonely Vermont back roads. He confessed in an accompanying note that he was beginningto be afraid of those roads, and that he would not even go into Townshend for supplies now exceptin broad daylight. It did not pay, he repeated again and again, to know too much unless onewere very remote from those silent and problematical hills. He would be going to Californiapretty soon to live with his son, though it was hard to leave a place where all one’smemories and ancestral feelings centred.
Before trying the record on the commercial machine which I borrowed from thecollege administration building I carefully went over all the explanatory matter in Akeley’svarious letters. This record, he had said, was obtained about 1 a.m. on the first of May, 1915,near the closed mouth of a cave where the wooded west slope of Dark Mountain rises out of Lee’sSwamp. The place had always been unusually plagued with strange voices, this being the reasonhe had brought the phonograph, dictaphone, and blank in expectation of results. Former experiencehad told him that May-Eve—the hideous Sabbat-night of underground European legend—wouldprobably be more fruitful than any other date, and he was not disappointed. It was noteworthy,though, that he never again heard voices at that particular spot.
Unlike most of the overheard forest voices, the substance of the record wasquasi-ritualistic, and included one palpably human voice which Akeley had never been able toplace. It was not Brown’s, but seemed to be that of a man of greater cultivation. Thesecond voice, however, was the real crux of the thing—for this was the accursed buzzingwhich had no likeness to humanity despite the human words which it uttered in good English grammarand a scholarly accent.
The recording phonograph and dictaphone had not worked uniformly well, andhad of course been at a great disadvantage because of the remote and muffled nature of the overheardritual; so that the actual speech secured was very fragmentary. Akeley had given me a transcriptof what he believed the spoken words to be, and I glanced through this again as I prepared themachine for action. The text was darkly mysterious rather than openly horrible, though a knowledgeof its origin and manner of gathering gave it all the associative horror which any words couldwell possess. I will present it here in full as I remember it—and I am fairly confidentthat I know it correctly by heart, not only from reading the transcript, but from playing therecord itself over and over again. It is not a thing which one might readily forget!

(SPEECH CUT OFF BY END OF RECORD)Such were the words for which I was to listen when I started the phonograph.It was with a trace of genuine dread and reluctance that I pressed the lever and heard the preliminaryscratching of the sapphire point, and I was glad that the first faint, fragmentary words werein a human voice—a mellow, educated voice which seemed vaguely Bostonian in accent, andwhich was certainly not that of any native of the Vermont hills. As I listened to the tantalisinglyfeeble rendering, I seemed to find the speech identical with Akeley’s carefully preparedtranscript. On it chanted, in that mellow Bostonian voice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Iä!Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
And then I heard the other voice. To this hour I shudder retrospectivelywhen I think of how it struck me, prepared though I was by Akeley’s accounts. Those towhom I have since described the record profess to find nothing but cheap imposture or madnessin it; but could they have heard the accursed thing itself, or read the bulk of Akeley’scorrespondence (especially that terrible and encyclopaedic second letter), I know they wouldthink differently. It is, after all, a tremendous pity that I did not disobey Akeley and playthe record for others—a tremendous pity, too, that all of his letters were lost. To me,with my first-hand impression of the actual sounds, and with my knowledge of the backgroundand surrounding circumstances, the voice was a monstrous thing. It swiftly followed the humanvoice in ritualistic response, but in my imagination it was a morbid echo winging its way acrossunimaginable abysses from unimaginable outer hells. It is more than two years now since I lastran off that blasphemous waxen cylinder; but at this moment, and at all other moments, I canstill hear that feeble, fiendish buzzing as it reached me for the first time.
“Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a ThousandYoung!”
But though that voice is always in my ears, I have not even yet been able toanalyse it well enough for a graphic description. It was like the drone of some loathsome, giganticinsect ponderously shaped into the articulate speech of an alien species, and I am perfectlycertain that the organs producing it can have no resemblance to the vocal organs of man, orindeed to those of any of the mammalia. There were singularities in timbre, range, and overtoneswhich placed this phenomenon wholly outside the sphere of humanity and earth-life. Its suddenadvent that first time almost stunned me, and I heard the rest of the record through in a sortof abstracted daze. When the longer passage of buzzing came, there was a sharp intensificationof that feeling of blasphemous infinity which had struck me during the shorter and earlier passage.At last the record ended abruptly, during an unusually clear speech of the human and Bostonianvoice; but I sat stupidly staring long after the machine had automatically stopped.
I hardly need say that I gave that shocking record many another playing, andthat I made exhaustive attempts at analysis and comment in comparing notes with Akeley. It wouldbe both useless and disturbing to repeat here all that we concluded; but I may hint that weagreed in believing we had secured a clue to the source of some of the most repulsive primordialcustoms in the cryptic elder religions of mankind. It seemed plain to us, also, that there wereancient and elaborate alliances between the hidden outer creatures and certain members of thehuman race. How extensive these alliances were, and how their state today might compare withtheir state in earlier ages, we had no means of guessing; yet at best there was room for a limitlessamount of horrified speculation. There seemed to be an awful, immemorial linkage in severaldefinite stages betwixt man and nameless infinity. The blasphemies which appeared on earth,it was hinted, came from the dark planet Yuggoth, at the rim of the solar system; but this wasitself merely the populous outpost of a frightful interstellar race whose ultimate source mustlie far outside even the Einsteinian space-time continuum or greatest known cosmos.
Meanwhile we continued to discuss the black stone and the best way of gettingit to Arkham—Akeley deeming it inadvisable to have me visit him at the scene of his nightmarestudies. For some reason or other, Akeley was afraid to trust the thing to any ordinary or expectedtransportation route. His final idea was to take it across county to Bellows Falls and shipit on the Boston and Maine system through Keene and Winchendon and Fitchburg, even though thiswould necessitate his driving along somewhat lonelier and more forest-traversing hill roadsthan the main highway to Brattleboro. He said he had noticed a man around the express officeat Brattleboro when he had sent the phonograph record, whose actions and expression had beenfar from reassuring. This man had seemed too anxious to talk with the clerks, and had takenthe train on which the record was shipped. Akeley confessed that he had not felt strictly atease about that record until he heard from me of its safe receipt.
About this time—the second week in July—another letter of minewent astray, as I learned through an anxious communication from Akeley. After that he told meto address him no more at Townshend, but to send all mail in care of the General Delivery atBrattleboro; whither he would make frequent trips either in his car or on the motor-coach linewhich had lately replaced passenger service on the lagging branch railway. I could see thathe was getting more and more anxious, for he went into much detail about the increased barkingof the dogs on moonless nights, and about the fresh claw-prints he sometimes found in the roadand in the mud at the back of his farmyard when morning came. Once he told about a veritablearmy of prints drawn up in a line facing an equally thick and resolute line of dog-tracks, andsent a loathsomely disturbing kodak picture to prove it. That was after a night on which thedogs had outdone themselves in barking and howling.
On the morning of Wednesday, July 18, I received a telegram from Bellows Falls,in which Akeley said he was expressing the black stone over the B. &amp; M. on Train No. 5508,leaving Bellows Falls at 12:15 p.m., standard time, and due at the North Station in Boston at4:12 p.m. It ought, I calculated, to get up to Arkham at least by the next noon; and accordinglyI stayed in all Thursday morning to receive it. But noon came and went without its advent, andwhen I telephoned down to the express office I was informed that no shipment for me had arrived.My next act, performed amidst a growing alarm, was to give a long-distance call to the expressagent at the Boston North Station; and I was scarcely surprised to learn that my consignmenthad not appeared. Train No. 5508 had pulled in only 35 minutes late on the day before, but hadcontained no box addressed to me. The agent promised, however, to institute a searching inquiry;and I ended the day by sending Akeley a night-letter outlining the situation.
With commendable promptness a report came from the Boston office on the followingafternoon, the agent telephoning as soon as he learned the facts. It seemed that the railwayexpress clerk on No. 5508 had been able to recall an incident which might have much bearingon my loss—an argument with a very curious-voiced man, lean, sandy, and rustic-looking,when the train was waiting at Keene, N.H., shortly after one o’clock standard time.
The man, he said, was greatly excited about a heavy box which he claimed toexpect, but which was neither on the train nor entered on the company’s books. He hadgiven the name of Stanley Adams, and had had such a queerly thick droning voice, that it madethe clerk abnormally dizzy and sleepy to listen to him. The clerk could not remember quite howthe conversation had ended, but recalled starting into a fuller awakeness when the train beganto move. The Boston agent added that this clerk was a young man of wholly unquestioned veracityand reliability, of known antecedents and long with the company.
That evening I went to Boston to interview the clerk in person, having obtainedhis name and address from the office. He was a frank, prepossessing fellow, but I saw that hecould add nothing to his original account. Oddly, he was scarcely sure that he could even recognisethe strange inquirer again. Realising that he had no more to tell, I returned to Arkham andsat up till morning writing letters to Akeley, to the express company, and to the police departmentand station agent in Keene. I felt that the strange-voiced man who had so queerly affected theclerk must have a pivotal place in the ominous business, and hoped that Keene station employeesand telegraph-office records might tell something about him and about how he happened to makehis inquiry when and where he did.
I must admit, however, that all my investigations came to nothing. The queer-voicedman had indeed been noticed around the Keene station in the early afternoon of July 18, andone lounger seemed to couple him vaguely with a heavy box; but he was altogether unknown, andhad not been seen before or since. He had not visited the telegraph office or received any messageso far as could be learned, nor had any message which might justly be considered a notice ofthe black stone’s presence on No. 5508 come through the office for anyone. Naturally Akeleyjoined with me in conducting these inquiries, and even made a personal trip to Keene to questionthe people around the station; but his attitude toward the matter was more fatalistic than mine.He seemed to find the loss of the box a portentous and menacing fulfilment of inevitable tendencies,and had no real hope at all of its recovery. He spoke of the undoubted telepathic and hypnoticpowers of the hill creatures and their agents, and in one letter hinted that he did not believethe stone was on this earth any longer. For my part, I was duly enraged, for I had felt therewas at least a chance of learning profound and astonishing things from the old, blurred hieroglyphs.The matter would have rankled bitterly in my mind had not Akeley’s immediate subsequentletters brought up a new phase of the whole horrible hill problem which at once seized all myattention.

IV.

The unknown things, Akeley wrote in a script grown pitifully tremulous, hadbegun to close in on him with a wholly new degree of determination. The nocturnal barking ofthe dogs whenever the moon was dim or absent was hideous now, and there had been attempts tomolest him on the lonely roads he had to traverse by day. On the second of August, while boundfor the village in his car, he had found a tree-trunk laid in his path at a point where thehighway ran through a deep patch of woods; while the savage barking of the two great dogs hehad with him told all too well of the things which must have been lurking near. What would havehappened had the dogs not been there, he did not dare guess—but he never went out nowwithout at least two of his faithful and powerful pack. Other road experiences had occurredon August 5th and 6th; a shot grazing his car on one occasion, and the barking of the dogs tellingof unholy woodland presences on the other.
On August 15th I received a frantic letter which disturbed me greatly, andwhich made me wish Akeley could put aside his lonely reticence and call in the aid of the law.There had been frightful happenings on the night of the 12-13th, bullets flying outside thefarmhouse, and three of the twelve great dogs being found shot dead in the morning. There weremyriads of claw-prints in the road, with the human prints of Walter Brown among them. Akeleyhad started to telephone to Brattleboro for more dogs, but the wire had gone dead before hehad a chance to say much. Later he went to Brattleboro in his car, and learned there that linemenhad found the main telephone cable neatly cut at a point where it ran through the deserted hillsnorth of Newfane. But he was about to start home with four fine new dogs, and several casesof ammunition for his big-game repeating rifle. The letter was written at the post office inBrattleboro, and came through to me without delay.
My attitude toward the matter was by this time quickly slipping from a scientificto an alarmedly personal one. I was afraid for Akeley in his remote, lonely farmhouse, and halfafraid for myself because of my now definite connexion with the strange hill problem. The thingwas reaching out so. Would it suck me in and engulf me? In replying to his letter I urgedhim to seek help, and hinted that I might take action myself if he did not. I spoke of visitingVermont in person in spite of his wishes, and of helping him explain the situation to the properauthorities. In return, however, I received only a telegram from Bellows Falls which read thus:
APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION BUT CAN DO NOTHING. TAKE NO ACTION YOURSELF FOR IT COULD ONLYHARM BOTH. WAIT FOR EXPLANATION.
HENRY AKELYBut the affair was steadily deepening. Upon my replying to the telegram I receiveda shaky note from Akeley with the astonishing news that he had not only never sent the wire,but had not received the letter from me to which it was an obvious reply. Hasty inquiries byhim at Bellows Falls had brought out that the message was deposited by a strange sandy-hairedman with a curiously thick, droning voice, though more than this he could not learn. The clerkshewed him the original text as scrawled in pencil by the sender, but the handwriting was whollyunfamiliar. It was noticeable that the signature was misspelled—A-K-E-L-Y, without thesecond “E”. Certain conjectures were inevitable, but amidst the obvious crisis hedid not stop to elaborate upon them.
He spoke of the death of more dogs and the purchase of still others, and ofthe exchange of gunfire which had become a settled feature each moonless night. Brown’sprints, and the prints of at least one or two more shod human figures, were now found regularlyamong the claw-prints in the road, and at the back of the farmyard. It was, Akeley admitted,a pretty bad business; and before long he would probably have to go to live with his Californiason whether or not he could sell the old place. But it was not easy to leave the only spot onecould really think of as home. He must try to hang on a little longer; perhaps he could scareoff the intruders—especially if he openly gave up all further attempts to penetrate theirsecrets.
Writing Akeley at once, I renewed my offers of aid, and spoke again of visitinghim and helping him convince the authorities of his dire peril. In his reply he seemed lessset against that plan than his past attitude would have led one to predict, but said he wouldlike to hold off a little while longer—long enough to get his things in order and reconcilehimself to the idea of leaving an almost morbidly cherished birthplace. People looked askanceat his studies and speculations, and it would be better to get quietly off without setting thecountryside in a turmoil and creating widespread doubts of his own sanity. He had had enough,he admitted, but he wanted to make a dignified exit if he could.
This letter reached me on the twenty-eighth of August, and I prepared and mailedas encouraging a reply as I could. Apparently the encouragement had effect, for Akeley had fewerterrors to report when he acknowledged my note. He was not very optimistic, though, and expressedthe belief that it was only the full moon season which was holding the creatures off. He hopedthere would not be many densely cloudy nights, and talked vaguely of boarding in Brattleborowhen the moon waned. Again I wrote him encouragingly, but on September 5th there came a freshcommunication which had obviously crossed my letter in the mails; and to this I could not giveany such hopeful response. In view of its importance I believe I had better give it in full—asbest I can do from memory of the shaky script. It ran substantially as follows:
Monday.Dear Wilmarth—
A rather discouraging P.S. to my last. Last night was thickly cloudy—thoughno rain—and not a bit of moonlight got through. Things were pretty bad, and I think theend is getting near, in spite of all we have hoped. After midnight something landed on the roofof the house, and the dogs all rushed up to see what it was. I could hear them snapping andtearing around, and then one managed to get on the roof by jumping from the low ell. There wasa terrible fight up there, and I heard a frightful buzzing which I’ll never forget.And then there was a shocking smell. About the same time bullets came through the window andnearly grazed me. I think the main line of the hill creatures had got close to the house whenthe dogs divided because of the roof business. What was up there I don’t know yet, butI’m afraid the creatures are learning to steer better with their space wings. I put outthe light and used the windows for loopholes, and raked all around the house with rifle fireaimed just high enough not to hit the dogs. That seemed to end the business, but in the morningI found great pools of blood in the yard, beside pools of a green sticky stuff that had theworst odour I have ever smelled. I climbed up on the roof and found more of the sticky stuffthere. Five of the dogs were killed—I’m afraid I hit one by aiming too low,for he was shot in the back. Now I am setting the panes the shots broke, and am going to Brattleborofor more dogs. I guess the men at the kennels think I am crazy. Will drop another note later.Suppose I’ll be ready for moving in a week or two, though it nearly kills me to thinkof it.
Hastily—
AKELEYBut this was not the only letter from Akeley to cross mine. On the next morning—September6th—still another came; this time a frantic scrawl which utterly unnerved me and put meat a loss what to say or do next. Again I cannot do better than quote the text as faithfullyas memory will let me.
Tuesday.Clouds didn’t break, so no moon again—and going into the wane anyhow.I’d have the house wired for electricity and put in a searchlight if I didn’t knowthey’d cut the cables as fast as they could be mended.
I think I am going crazy. It may be that all I have ever written you is a dreamor madness. It was bad enough before, but this time it is too much. They talked to me lastnight—talked in that cursed buzzing voice and told me things that I dare not repeatto you. I heard them plainly over the barking of the dogs, and once when they were drownedout a human voice helped them. Keep out of this, Wilmarth—it is worse than eitheryou or I ever suspected. They don’t mean to let me get to California now—theywant to take me off alive, or what theoretically and mentally amounts to alive—notonly to Yuggoth, but beyond that—away outside the galaxy and possibly beyond the lastcurved rim of space. I told them I wouldn’t go where they wish, or in the terribleway they propose to take me, but I’m afraid it will be no use. My place is so farout that they may come by day as well as by night before long. Six more dogs killed, and I feltpresences all along the wooded parts of the road when I drove to Brattleboro today.
It was a mistake for me to try to send you that phonograph record and blackstone. Better smash the record before it’s too late. Will drop you another line tomorrowif I’m still here. Wish I could arrange to get my books and things to Brattleboro andboard there. I would run off without anything if I could, but something inside my mind holdsme back. I can slip out to Brattleboro, where I ought to be safe, but I feel just as much aprisoner there as at the house. And I seem to know that I couldn’t get much farther evenif I dropped everything and tried. It is horrible—don’t get mixed up in this.
Yrs—AKELEYI did not sleep at all the night after receiving this terrible thing, and wasutterly baffled as to Akeley’s remaining degree of sanity. The substance of the note waswholly insane, yet the manner of expression—in view of all that had gone before—hada grimly potent quality of convincingness. I made no attempt to answer it, thinking it betterto wait until Akeley might have time to reply to my latest communication. Such a reply indeedcame on the following day, though the fresh material in it quite overshadowed any of the pointsbrought up by the letter it nominally answered. Here is what I recall of the text, scrawledand blotted as it was in the course of a plainly frantic and hurried composition.
Wednesday.W—
Yr letter came, but it’s no use to discuss anything any more. I am fullyresigned. Wonder that I have even enough will power left to fight them off. Can’t escapeeven if I were willing to give up everything and run. They’ll get me.
Had a letter from them yesterday—R.F.D. man brought it while Iwas at Brattleboro. Typed and postmarked Bellows Falls. Tells what they want to do with me—Ican’t repeat it. Look out for yourself, too! Smash that record. Cloudy nights keep up,and moon waning all the time. Wish I dared to get help—it might brace up my will power—buteveryone who would dare to come at all would call me crazy unless there happened to be someproof. Couldn’t ask people to come for no reason at all—am all out of touch witheverybody and have been for years. 
But I haven’t told you the worst, Wilmarth. Brace up to read this, forit will give you a shock. I am telling the truth, though. It is this—I have seen andtouched one of the things, or part of one of the things. God, man, but it’s awful!It was dead, of course. One of the dogs had it, and I found it near the kennel this morning.I tried to save it in the woodshed to convince people of the whole thing, but it all evaporatedin a few hours. Nothing left. You know, all those things in the rivers were seen only on thefirst morning after the flood. And here’s the worst. I tried to photograph it for you,but when I developed the film there wasn’t anything visible except the woodshed.What can the thing have been made of? I saw it and felt it, and they all leave footprints. Itwas surely made of matter—but what kind of matter? The shape can’t be described.It was a great crab with a lot of pyramided fleshy rings or knots of thick, ropy stuff coveredwith feelers where a man’s head would be. That green sticky stuff is its blood or juice.And there are more of them due on earth any minute.
Walter Brown is missing—hasn’t been seen loafing around any ofhis usual corners in the villages hereabouts. I must have got him with one of my shots, thoughthe creatures always seem to try to take their dead and wounded away.
Got into town this afternoon without any trouble, but am afraid they’rebeginning to hold off because they’re sure of me. Am writing this in Brattleboro P.O.This may be goodbye—if it is, write my son George Goodenough Akeley, 176 Pleasant St.,San Diego, Cal., but don’t come up here. Write the boy if you don’t hearfrom me in a week, and watch the papers for news.
I’m going to play my last two cards now—if I have the will powerleft. First to try poison gas on the things (I’ve got the right chemicals and have fixedup masks for myself and the dogs) and then if that doesn’t work, tell the sheriff. Theycan lock me in a madhouse if they want to—it’ll be better than what the othercreatures would do. Perhaps I can get them to pay attention to the prints around the house—theyare faint, but I can find them every morning. Suppose, though, police would say I faked themsomehow; for they all think I’m a queer character.
Must try to have a state policeman spend a night here and see for himself—thoughit would be just like the creatures to learn about it and hold off that night. They cut my wireswhenever I try to telephone in the night—the linemen think it is very queer, and may testifyfor me if they don’t go and imagine I cut them myself. I haven’t tried to keep themrepaired for over a week now.
I could get some of the ignorant people to testify for me about the realityof the horrors, but everybody laughs at what they say, and anyway, they have shunned my placefor so long that they don’t know any of the new events. You couldn’t get one ofthose run-down farmers to come within a mile of my house for love or money. The mail-carrierhears what they say and jokes me about it—God! If I only dared tell him how real it is!I think I’ll try to get him to notice the prints, but he comes in the afternoon and they’reusually about gone by that time. If I kept one by setting a box or pan over it, he’d thinksurely it was a fake or joke.
Wish I hadn’t gotten to be such a hermit, so folks don’t drop aroundas they used to. I’ve never dared shew the black stone or the kodak pictures, or playthat record, to anybody but the ignorant people. The others would say I faked the whole businessand do nothing but laugh. But I may yet try shewing the pictures. They give those claw-printsclearly, even if the things that made them can’t be photographed. What a shame nobodyelse saw that thing this morning before it went to nothing!
But I don’t know as I care. After what I’ve been through, a madhouseis as good a place as any. The doctors can help me make up my mind to get away from this house,and that is all that will save me.
Write my son George if you don’t hear soon. Goodbye, smash that record,and don’t mix up in this.
Yrs—AKELEYThe letter frankly plunged me into the blackest of terror. I did not know whatto say in answer, but scratched off some incoherent words of advice and encouragement and sentthem by registered mail. I recall urging Akeley to move to Brattleboro at once, and place himselfunder the protection of the authorities; adding that I would come to that town with the phonographrecord and help convince the courts of his sanity. It was time, too, I think I wrote, to alarmthe people generally against this thing in their midst. It will be observed that at this momentof stress my own belief in all Akeley had told and claimed was virtually complete, though Idid think his failure to get a picture of the dead monster was due not to any freak of Naturebut to some excited slip of his own.

V.

Then, apparently crossing my incoherent note and reaching me Saturday afternoon,September 8th, came that curiously different and calming letter neatly typed on a new machine;that strange letter of reassurance and invitation which must have marked so prodigious a transitionin the whole nightmare drama of the lonely hills. Again I will quote from memory—seekingfor special reasons to preserve as much of the flavour of the style as I can. It was postmarkedBellows Falls, and the signature as well as the body of the letter was typed—as is frequentwith beginners in typing. The text, though, was marvellously accurate for a tyro’s work;and I concluded that Akeley must have used a machine at some previous period—perhaps incollege. To say that the letter relieved me would be only fair, yet beneath my relief lay asubstratum of uneasiness. If Akeley had been sane in his terror, was he now sane in his deliverance?And the sort of “improved rapport” mentioned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was it? Theentire thing implied such a diametrical reversal of Akeley’s previous attitude! But hereis the substance of the text, carefully transcribed from a memory in which I take some pride.
                  Townshend, Vermont,
            Thursday, Sept. 6, 1928.         My dear Wilmarth:—
It gives me great pleasure to be able to set you at rest regarding all thesilly things I’ve been writing you. I say “silly”, although by that I meanmy frightened attitude rather than my descriptions of certain phenomena. Those phenomena arereal and important enough; my mistake had been in establishing an anomalous attitude towardthem.
I think I mentioned that my strange visitors were beginning to communicatewith me, and to attempt such communication. Last night this exchange of speech became actual.In response to certain signals I admitted to the house a messenger from those outside—afellow-human, let me hasten to say. He told me much that neither you nor I had even begun toguess, and shewed clearly how totally we had misjudged and misinterpreted the purpose of theOuter Ones in maintaining their secret colony on this planet.
It seems that the evil legends about what they have offered to men, and whatthey wish in connexion with the earth, are wholly the result of an ignorant misconception ofallegorical speech—speech, of course, moulded by cultural backgrounds and thought-habitsvastly different from anything we dream of. My own conjectures, I freely own, shot as widelypast the mark as any of the guesses of illiterate farmers and savage Indians. What I had thoughtmorbid and shameful and ignominious is in reality awesome and mind-expanding and even glorious—myprevious estimate being merely a phase of man’s eternal tendency to hate and fear andshrink from the utterly different.
Now I regret the harm I have inflicted upon these alien and incredible beingsin the course of our nightly skirmishes. If only I had consented to talk peacefully and reasonablywith them in the first place! But they bear me no grudge, their emotions being organised verydifferently from ours. It is their misfortune to have had as their human agents in Vermont somevery inferior specimens—the late Walter Brown, for example. He prejudiced me vastly againstthem. Actually, they have never knowingly harmed men, but have often been cruelly wronged andspied upon by our species. There is a whole secret cult of evil men (a man of your mysticalerudition will understand me when I link them with Hastur and the Yellow Sign) devoted to thepurpose of tracking them down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions.It is against these aggressors—not against normal humanity—that the drastic precautionsof the Outer Ones are directed. Incidentally, I learned that many of our lost letters were stolennot by the Outer Ones but by the emissaries of this malign cult.
All that the Outer Ones wish of man is peace and non-molestation and an increasingintellectual rapport. This latter is absolutely necessary now that our inventions and devicesare expanding our knowledge and motions, and making it more and more impossible for the OuterOnes’ necessary outposts to exist secretly on this planet. The alien beings desireto know mankind more fully, and to have a few of mankind’s philosophic and scientificleaders know more about them. With such an exchange of knowledge all perils will pass, and asatisfactory modus vivendi be established. The very idea of any attempt to enslaveor degrade mankind is ridiculous.
As a beginning of this improved rapport, the Outer Ones have naturally chosenme—whose knowledge of them is already so considerable—as their primary interpreteron earth. Much was told me last night—facts of the most stupendous and vista-opening nature—andmore will be subsequently communicated to me both orally and in writing. I shall not be calledupon to make any trip outside just yet, though I shall probably wish to do solater on—employing special means and transcending everything which we have hitherto beenaccustomed to regard as human experience. My house will be besieged no longer. Everything hasreverted to normal, and the dogs will have no further occupation. In place of terror I havebeen given a rich boon of knowledge and intellectual adventure which few other mortals haveever shared.
The Outer Beings are perhaps the most marvellous organic things in or beyondall space and time—members of a cosmos-wide race of which all other life-forms are merelydegenerate variants. They are more vegetable than animal, if these terms can be applied to thesort of matter composing them, and have a somewhat fungoid structure; though the presence ofa chlorophyll-like substance and a very singular nutritive system differentiate them altogetherfrom true cormophytic fungi. Indeed, the type is composed of a form of matter totally aliento our part of space—with electrons having a wholly different vibration-rate. That iswhy the beings cannot be photographed on the ordinary camera films and plates of ourknown universe, even though our eyes can see them. With proper knowledge, however, any goodchemist could make a photographic emulsion which would record their images.
The genus is unique in its ability to traverse the heatless and airless interstellarvoid in full corporeal form, and some of its variants cannot do this without mechanical aidor curious surgical transpositions. Only a few species have the ether-resisting wings characteristicof the Vermont variety. Those inhabiting certain remote peaks in the Old World were broughtin other ways. Their external resemblance to animal life, and to the sort of structure we understandas material, is a matter of parallel evolution rather than of close kinship. Their brain-capacityexceeds that of any other surviving life-form, although the winged types of our hill countryare by no means the most highly developed. Telepathy is their usual means of discourse, thoughthey have rudimentary vocal organs which, after a slight operation (for surgery is an incrediblyexpert and every-day thing among them), can roughly duplicate the speech of such types of organismas still use speech.
Their main immediate abode is a still undiscovered and almost lightlessplanet at the very edge of our solar system—beyond Neptune, and the ninth in distancefrom the sun. It is, as we have inferred, the object mystically hinted at as “Yuggoth”in certain ancient and forbidden writings; and it will soon be the scene of a strange focussingof thought upon our world in an effort to facilitate mental rapport. I would not be surprisedif astronomers became sufficiently sensitive to these thought-currents to discover Yuggoth whenthe Outer Ones wish them to do so. But Yuggoth, of course, is only the stepping-stone. The mainbody of the beings inhabits strangely organised abysses wholly beyond the utmost reach of anyhuman imagination. The space-time globule which we recognise as the totality of all cosmic entityis only an atom in the genuine infinity which is theirs. And as much of this infinity asany human brain can hold is eventually to be opened up to me, as it has been to not more thanfifty other men since the human race has existed.
You will probably call this raving at first, Wilmarth, but in time you willappreciate the titanic opportunity I have stumbled upon. I want you to share as much of it asis possible, and to that end must tell you thousands of things that won’t go on paper.In the past I have warned you not to come to see me. Now that all is safe, I take pleasure inrescinding that warning and inviting you.
Can’t you make a trip up here before your college term opens? It wouldbe marvellously delightful if you could. Bring along the phonograph record and all my lettersto you as consultative data—we shall need them in piecing together the whole tremendousstory. You might bring the kodak prints, too, since I seem to have mislaid the negatives andmy own prints in all this recent excitement. But what a wealth of facts I have to add to allthis groping and tentative material—and what a stupendous device I have to supplementmy additions!
Don’t hesitate—I am free from espionage now, and you will not meetanything unnatural or disturbing. Just come along and let my car meet you at the Brattleborostation—prepare to stay as long as you can, and expect many an evening of discussion ofthings beyond all human conjecture. Don’t tell anyone about it, of course—for thismatter must not get to the promiscuous public.
The train service to Brattleboro is not bad—you can get a time-tablein Boston. Take the B. &amp; M. to Greenfield, and then change for the brief remainder of theway. I suggest your taking the convenient 4:10 p.m.—standard—from Boston. This getsinto Greenfield at 7:35, and at 9:19 a train leaves there which reaches Brattleboro at 10:01.That is week-days. Let me know the date and I’ll have my car on hand at the station.
Pardon this typed letter, but my handwriting has grown shaky of late, as youknow, and I don’t feel equal to long stretches of script. I got this new Corona in Brattleboroyesterday—it seems to work very well.
Awaiting word, and hoping to see you shortly with the phonograph record andall my letters—and the kodak prints—
                  I am
            Yours in anticipation,
            HENRY W. AKELEY.         To Albert N. Wilmarth, Esq.,
Miskatonic University,
Arkham, Mass.The complexity of my emotions upon reading, re-reading, and pondering overthis strange and unlooked-for letter is past adequate description. I have said that I was atonce relieved and made uneasy, but this expresses only crudely the overtones of diverse andlargely subconscious feelings which comprised both the relief and the uneasiness. To begin with,the thing was so antipodally at variance with the whole chain of horrors preceding it—thechange of mood from stark terror to cool complacency and even exultation was so unheralded,lightning-like, and complete! I could scarcely believe that a single day could so alter thepsychological perspective of one who had written that final frenzied bulletin of Wednesday,no matter what relieving disclosures that day might have brought. At certain moments a senseof conflicting unrealities made me wonder whether this whole distantly reported drama of fantasticforces were not a kind of half-illusory dream created largely within my own mind. Then I thoughtof the phonograph record and gave way to still greater bewilderment.
The letter seemed so unlike anything which could have been expected! As I analysedmy impression, I saw that it consisted of two distinct phases. First, granting that Akeley hadbeen sane before and was still sane, the indicated change in the situation itself was so swiftand unthinkable. And secondly, the change in Akeley’s own manner, attitude, and languagewas so vastly beyond the normal or the predictable. The man’s whole personality seemedto have undergone an insidious mutation—a mutation so deep that one could scarcely reconcilehis two aspects with the supposition that both represented equal sanity. Word-choice, spelling—allwere subtly different. And with my academic sensitiveness to prose style, I could trace profounddivergences in his commonest reactions and rhythm-responses. Certainly, the emotional cataclysmor revelation which could produce so radical an overturn must be an extreme one indeed! Yetin another way the letter seemed quite characteristic of Akeley. The same old passion for infinity—thesame old scholarly inquisitiveness. I could not a moment—or more than a moment—creditthe idea of spuriousness or malign substitution. Did not the invitation—the willingnessto have me test the truth of the letter in person—prove its genuineness?
I did not retire Saturday night, but sat up thinking of the shadows and marvelsbehind the letter I had received. My mind, aching from the quick succession of monstrous conceptionsit had been forced to confront during the last four months, worked upon this startling new materialin a cycle of doubt and acceptance which repeated most of the steps experienced in facing theearlier wonders; till long before dawn a burning interest and curiosity had begun to replacethe original storm of perplexity and uneasiness. Mad or sane, metamorphosed or merely relieved,the chances were that Akeley had actually encountered some stupendous change of perspectivein his hazardous research; some change at once diminishing his danger—real or fancied—andopening dizzy new vistas of cosmic and superhuman knowledge. My own zeal for the unknown flaredup to meet his, and I felt myself touched by the contagion of the morbid barrier-breaking. Toshake off the maddening and wearying limitations of time and space and natural law—tobe linked with the vast outside—to come close to the nighted and abysmal secretsof the infinite and the ultimate—surely such a thing was worth the risk of one’slife, soul, and sanity! And Akeley had said there was no longer any peril—he had invitedme to visit him instead of warning me away as before. I tingled at the thought of what he mightnow have to tell me—there was an almost paralysing fascination in the thought of sittingin that lonely and lately beleaguered farmhouse with a man who had talked with actual emissariesfrom outer space; sitting there with the terrible record and the pile of letters in which Akeleyhad summarised his earlier conclusions.
So late Sunday morning I telegraphed Akeley that I would meet him in Brattleboroon the following Wednesday—September 12th—if that date were convenient for him.In only one respect did I depart from his suggestions, and that concerned the choice of a train.Frankly, I did not feel like arriving in that haunted Vermont region late at night; so insteadof accepting the train he chose I telephoned the station and devised another arrangement. Byrising early and taking the 8:07 a.m. (standard) into Boston, I could catch the 9:25 for Greenfield;arriving there at 12:22 noon. This connected exactly with a train reaching Brattleboro at 1:08p.m.—a much more comfortable hour than 10:01 for meeting Akeley and riding with him intothe close-packed, secret-guarding hills.
I mentioned this choice in my telegram, and was glad to learn in the replywhich came toward evening that it had met with my prospective host’s endorsement. Hiswire ran thus:
ARRANGEMENT SATISFACTORY. WILL MEET 1:08 TRAIN WEDNESDAY. DON’T FORGET RECORD ANDLETTERS AND PRINTS. KEEP DESTINATION QUIET. EXPECT GREAT REVELATIONS.
AKELEY.Receipt of this message in direct response to one sent to Akeley—andnecessarily delivered to his house from the Townshend station either by official messenger orby a restored telephone service—removed any lingering subconscious doubts I may have hadabout the authorship of the perplexing letter. My relief was marked—indeed, it was greaterthan I could account for at that time; since all such doubts had been rather deeply buried.But I slept soundly and long that night, and was eagerly busy with preparations during the ensuingtwo days.

VI.

On Wednesday I started as agreed, taking with me a valise full of simple necessitiesand scientific data, including the hideous phonograph record, the kodak prints, and the entirefile of Akeley’s correspondence. As requested, I had told no one where I was going; forI could see that the matter demanded utmost privacy, even allowing for its most favourable turns.The thought of actual mental contact with alien, outside entities was stupefying enough to mytrained and somewhat prepared mind; and this being so, what might one think of its effect onthe vast masses of uninformed laymen? I do not know whether dread or adventurous expectancywas uppermost in me as I changed trains in Boston and began the long westward run out of familiarregions into those I knew less thoroughly. Waltham—Concord—Ayer—Fitchburg—Gardner—Athol—
My train reached Greenfield seven minutes late, but the northbound connectingexpress had been held. Transferring in haste, I felt a curious breathlessness as the cars rumbledon through the early afternoon sunlight into territories I had always read of but had neverbefore visited. I knew I was entering an altogether older-fashioned and more primitive New Englandthan the mechanised, urbanised coastal and southern areas where all my life had been spent;an unspoiled, ancestral New England without the foreigners and factory-smoke, billboards andconcrete roads, of the sections which modernity has touched. There would be odd survivals ofthat continuous native life whose deep roots make it the one authentic outgrowth of the landscape—thecontinuous native life which keeps alive strange ancient memories, and fertilises the soil forshadowy, marvellous, and seldom-mentioned beliefs.
Now and then I saw the blue Connecticut River gleaming in the sun, and afterleaving Northfield we crossed it. Ahead loomed green and cryptical hills, and when the conductorcame around I learned that I was at last in Vermont. He told me to set my watch back an hour,since the northern hill country will have no dealings with new-fangled daylight time schemes.As I did so it seemed to me that I was likewise turning the calendar back a century.
The train kept close to the river, and across in New Hampshire I could seethe approaching slope of steep Wantastiquet, about which singular old legends cluster. Thenstreets appeared on my left, and a green island shewed in the stream on my right. People roseand filed to the door, and I followed them. The car stopped, and I alighted beneath the longtrain-shed of the Brattleboro station.
Looking over the line of waiting motors I hesitated a moment to see which onemight turn out to be the Akeley Ford, but my identity was divined before I could take the initiative.And yet it was clearly not Akeley himself who advanced to meet me with an outstretched handand a mellowly phrased query as to whether I was indeed Mr. Albert N. Wilmarth of Arkham. Thisman bore no resemblance to the bearded, grizzled Akeley of the snapshot; but was a younger andmore urban person, fashionably dressed, and wearing only a small, dark moustache. His cultivatedvoice held an odd and almost disturbing hint of vague familiarity, though I could not definitelyplace it in my memory.
As I surveyed him I heard him explaining that he was a friend of my prospectivehost’s who had come down from Townshend in his stead. Akeley, he declared, had suffereda sudden attack of some asthmatic trouble, and did not feel equal to making a trip in the outdoorair. It was not serious, however, and there was to be no change in plans regarding my visit.I could not make out just how much this Mr. Noyes—as he announced himself—knew ofAkeley’s researches and discoveries, though it seemed to me that his casual manner stampedhim as a comparative outsider. Remembering what a hermit Akeley had been, I was a trifle surprisedat the ready availability of such a friend; but did not let my puzzlement deter me from enteringthe motor to which he gestured me. It was not the small ancient car I had expected from Akeley’sdescriptions, but a large and immaculate specimen of recent pattern—apparently Noyes’sown, and bearing Massachusetts licence plates with the amusing “sacred codfish”device of that year. My guide, I concluded, must be a summer transient in the Townshend region.
Noyes climbed into the car beside me and started it at once. I was glad thathe did not overflow with conversation, for some peculiar atmospheric tensity made me feel disinclinedto talk. The town seemed very attractive in the afternoon sunlight as we swept up an inclineand turned to the right into the main street. It drowsed like the older New England cities whichone remembers from boyhood, and something in the collocation of roofs and steeples and chimneysand brick walls formed contours touching deep viol-strings of ancestral emotion. I could tellthat I was at the gateway of a region half-bewitched through the piling-up of unbroken time-accumulations;a region where old, strange things have had a chance to grow and linger because they have neverbeen stirred up.
As we passed out of Brattleboro my sense of constraint and foreboding increased,for a vague quality in the hill-crowded countryside with its towering, threatening, close-pressinggreen and granite slopes hinted at obscure secrets and immemorial survivals which might or mightnot be hostile to mankind. For a time our course followed a broad, shallow river which floweddown from unknown hills in the north, and I shivered when my companion told me it was the WestRiver. It was in this stream, I recalled from newspaper items, that one of the morbid crab-likebeings had been seen floating after the floods.
Gradually the country around us grew wilder and more deserted. Archaic coveredbridges lingered fearsomely out of the past in pockets of the hills, and the half-abandonedrailway track paralleling the river seemed to exhale a nebulously visible air of desolation.There were awesome sweeps of vivid valley where great cliffs rose, New England’s virgingranite shewing grey and austere through the verdure that scaled the crests. There were gorgeswhere untamed streams leaped, bearing down toward the river the unimagined secrets of a thousandpathless peaks. Branching away now and then were narrow, half-concealed roads that bored theirway through solid, luxuriant masses of forest among whose primal trees whole armies of elementalspirits might well lurk. As I saw these I thought of how Akeley had been molested by unseenagencies on his drives along this very route, and did not wonder that such things could be.
The quaint, sightly village of Newfane, reached in less than an hour, was ourlast link with that world which man can definitely call his own by virtue of conquest and completeoccupancy. After that we cast off all allegiance to immediate, tangible, and time-touched things,and entered a fantastic world of hushed unreality in which the narrow, ribbon-like road roseand fell and curved with an almost sentient and purposeful caprice amidst the tenantless greenpeaks and half-deserted valleys. Except for the sound of the motor, and the faint stir of thefew lonely farms we passed at infrequent intervals, the only thing that reached my ears wasthe gurgling, insidious trickle of strange waters from numberless hidden fountains in the shadowywoods.
The nearness and intimacy of the dwarfed, domed hills now became veritablybreath-taking. Their steepness and abruptness were even greater than I had imagined from hearsay,and suggested nothing in common with the prosaic objective world we know. The dense, unvisitedwoods on those inaccessible slopes seemed to harbour alien and incredible things, and I feltthat the very outline of the hills themselves held some strange and aeon-forgotten meaning,as if they were vast hieroglyphs left by a rumoured titan race whose glories live only in rare,deep dreams. All the legends of the past, and all the stupefying imputations of Henry Akeley’sletters and exhibits, welled up in my memory to heighten the atmosphere of tension and growingmenace. The purpose of my visit, and the frightful abnormalities it postulated, struck me allat once with a chill sensation that nearly overbalanced my ardour for strange delvings.
My guide must have noticed my disturbed attitude; for as the road grew wilderand more irregular, and our motion slower and more jolting, his occasional pleasant commentsexpanded into a steadier flow of discourse. He spoke of the beauty and weirdness of the country,and revealed some acquaintance with the folklore studies of my prospective host. From his politequestions it was obvious that he knew I had come for a scientific purpose, and that I was bringingdata of some importance; but he gave no sign of appreciating the depth and awfulness of theknowledge which Akeley had finally reached.
His manner was so cheerful, normal, and urbane that his remarks ought to havecalmed and reassured me; but oddly enough, I felt only the more disturbed as we bumped and veeredonward into the unknown wilderness of hills and woods. At times it seemed as if he were pumpingme to see what I knew of the monstrous secrets of the place, and with every fresh utterancethat vague, teasing, baffling familiarity in his voice increased. It was not an ordinaryor healthy familiarity despite the thoroughly wholesome and cultivated nature of the voice.I somehow linked it with forgotten nightmares, and felt that I might go mad if I recognisedit. If any good excuse had existed, I think I would have turned back from my visit. As it was,I could not well do so—and it occurred to me that a cool, scientific conversation withAkeley himself after my arrival would help greatly to pull me together.
Besides, there was a strangely calming element of cosmic beauty in the hypnoticlandscape through which we climbed and plunged fantastically. Time had lost itself in the labyrinthsbehind, and around us stretched only the flowering waves of faery and the recaptured lovelinessof vanished centuries—the hoary groves, the untainted pastures edged with gay autumnalblossoms, and at vast intervals the small brown farmsteads nestling amidst huge trees beneathvertical precipices of fragrant brier and meadow-grass. Even the sunlight assumed a supernalglamour, as if some special atmosphere or exhalation mantled the whole region. I had seen nothinglike it before save in the magic vistas that sometimes form the backgrounds of Italian primitives.Sodoma and Leonardo conceived such expanses, but only in the distance, and through the vaultingsof Renaissance arcades. We were now burrowing bodily through the midst of the picture, and Iseemed to find in its necromancy a thing I had innately known or inherited, and for which Ihad always been vainly searching.
Suddenly, after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent, thecar came to a standstill. On my left, across a well-kept lawn which stretched to the road andflaunted a border of whitewashed stones, rose a white, two-and-a-half-story house of unusualsize and elegance for the region, with a congeries of contiguous or arcade-linked barns, sheds,and windmill behind and to the right. I recognised it at once from the snapshot I had received,and was not surprised to see the name of Henry Akeley on the galvanised-iron mail-box near theroad. For some distance back of the house a level stretch of marshy and sparsely wooded landextended, beyond which soared a steep, thickly forested hillside ending in a jagged leafy crest.This latter, I knew, was the summit of Dark Mountain, half way up which we must have climbedalready.
Alighting from the car and taking my valise, Noyes asked me to wait while hewent in and notified Akeley of my advent. He himself, he added, had important business elsewhere,and could not stop for more than a moment. As he briskly walked up the path to the house I climbedout of the car myself, wishing to stretch my legs a little before settling down to a sedentaryconversation. My feeling of nervousness and tension had risen to a maximum again now that Iwas on the actual scene of the morbid beleaguering described so hauntingly in Akeley’sletters, and I honestly dreaded the coming discussions which were to link me with such alienand forbidden worlds.
Close contact with the utterly bizarre is often more terrifying than inspiring,and it did not cheer me to think that this very bit of dusty road was the place where thosemonstrous tracks and that foetid green ichor had been found after moonless nights of fear anddeath. Idly I noticed that none of Akeley’s dogs seemed to be about. Had he sold themall as soon as the Outer Ones made peace with him? Try as I might, I could not have the sameconfidence in the depth and sincerity of that peace which appeared in Akeley’s final andqueerly different letter. After all, he was a man of much simplicity and with little worldlyexperience. Was there not, perhaps, some deep and sinister undercurrent beneath the surfaceof the new alliance?
Led by my thoughts, my eyes turned downward to the powdery road surface whichhad held such hideous testimonies. The last few days had been dry, and tracks of all sorts clutteredthe rutted, irregular highway despite the unfrequented nature of the district. With a vaguecuriosity I began to trace the outline of some of the heterogeneous impressions, trying meanwhileto curb the flights of macabre fancy which the place and its memories suggested. There was somethingmenacing and uncomfortable in the funereal stillness, in the muffled, subtle trickle of distantbrooks, and in the crowding green peaks and black-wooded precipices that choked the narrow horizon.
And then an image shot into my consciousness which made those vague menacesand flights of fancy seem mild and insignificant indeed. I have said that I was scanning themiscellaneous prints in the road with a kind of idle curiosity—but all at once that curiositywas shockingly snuffed out by a sudden and paralysing gust of active terror. For though thedust tracks were in general confused and overlapping, and unlikely to arrest any casual gaze,my restless vision had caught certain details near the spot where the path to the house joinedthe highway; and had recognised beyond doubt or hope the frightful significance of those details.It was not for nothing, alas, that I had pored for hours over the kodak views of the Outer Ones’claw-prints which Akeley had sent. Too well did I know the marks of those loathsome nippers,and that hint of ambiguous direction which stamped the horrors as no creatures of this planet.No chance had been left me for merciful mistake. Here, indeed, in objective form before my owneyes, and surely made not many hours ago, were at least three marks which stood out blasphemouslyamong the surprising plethora of blurred footprints leading to and from the Akeley farmhouse.They were the hellish tracks of the living fungi from Yuggoth.
I pulled myself together in time to stifle a scream. After all, what more wasthere than I might have expected, assuming that I had really believed Akeley’s letters?He had spoken of making peace with the things. Why, then, was it strange that some of them hadvisited his house? But the terror was stronger than the reassurance. Could any man be expectedto look unmoved for the first time upon the claw-marks of animate beings from outer depths ofspace? Just then I saw Noyes emerge from the door and approach with a brisk step. I must, Ireflected, keep command of myself, for the chances were this genial friend knew nothing of Akeley’sprofoundest and most stupendous probings into the forbidden.
Akeley, Noyes hastened to inform me, was glad and ready to see me; althoughhis sudden attack of asthma would prevent him from being a very competent host for a day ortwo. These spells hit him hard when they came, and were always accompanied by a debilitatingfever and general weakness. He never was good for much while they lasted—had to talk ina whisper, and was very clumsy and feeble in getting about. His feet and ankles swelled, too,so that he had to bandage them like a gouty old beef-eater. Today he was in rather bad shape,so that I would have to attend very largely to my own needs; but he was none the less eagerfor conversation. I would find him in the study at the left of the front hall—the roomwhere the blinds were shut. He had to keep the sunlight out when he was ill, for his eyes werevery sensitive.
As Noyes bade me adieu and rode off northward in his car I began to walk slowlytoward the house. The door had been left ajar for me; but before approaching and entering Icast a searching glance around the whole place, trying to decide what had struck me as so intangiblyqueer about it. The barns and sheds looked trimly prosaic enough, and I noticed Akeley’sbattered Ford in its capacious, unguarded shelter. Then the secret of the queerness reachedme. It was the total silence. Ordinarily a farm is at least moderately murmurous from its variouskinds of livestock, but here all signs of life were missing. What of the hens and the hogs?The cows, of which Akeley had said he possessed several, might conceivably be out to pasture,and the dogs might possibly have been sold; but the absence of any trace of cackling or gruntingwas truly singular.
I did not pause long on the path, but resolutely entered the open house doorand closed it behind me. It had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so, and now thatI was shut inside I had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat. Not that the place wasin the least sinister in visual suggestion; on the contrary, I thought the graceful late-colonialhallway very tasteful and wholesome, and admired the evident breeding of the man who had furnishedit. What made me wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable. Perhaps it wasa certain odd odour which I thought I noticed—though I well knew how common musty odoursare in even the best of ancient farmhouses.

VII.

Refusing to let these cloudy qualms overmaster me, I recalled Noyes’sinstructions and pushed open the six-panelled, brass-latched white door on my left. The roombeyond was darkened, as I had known before; and as I entered it I noticed that the queer odourwas stronger there. There likewise appeared to be some faint, half-imaginary rhythm or vibrationin the air. For a moment the closed blinds allowed me to see very little, but then a kind ofapologetic hacking or whispering sound drew my attention to a great easy-chair in the farther,darker corner of the room. Within its shadowy depths I saw the white blur of a man’s faceand hands; and in a moment I had crossed to greet the figure who had tried to speak. Dim thoughthe light was, I perceived that this was indeed my host. I had studied the kodak picture repeatedly,and there could be no mistake about this firm, weather-beaten face with the cropped, grizzledbeard.
But as I looked again my recognition was mixed with sadness and anxiety; forcertainly, this face was that of a very sick man. I felt that there must be something more thanasthma behind that strained, rigid, immobile expression and unwinking glassy stare; and realisedhow terribly the strain of his frightful experiences must have told on him. Was it not enoughto break any human being—even a younger man than this intrepid delver into the forbidden?The strange and sudden relief, I feared, had come too late to save him from something like ageneral breakdown. There was a touch of the pitiful in the limp, lifeless way his lean handsrested in his lap. He had on a loose dressing-gown, and was swathed around the head and higharound the neck with a vivid yellow scarf or hood.
And then I saw that he was trying to talk in the same hacking whisper withwhich he had greeted me. It was a hard whisper to catch at first, since the grey moustache concealedall movements of the lips, and something in its timbre disturbed me greatly; but by concentratingmy attention I could soon make out its purport surprisingly well. The accent was by no meansa rustic one, and the language was even more polished than correspondence had led me to expect.
“Mr. Wilmarth, I presume? You must pardon my not rising. I am quite ill,as Mr. Noyes must have told you; but I could not resist having you come just the same. You knowwhat I wrote in my last letter—there is so much to tell you tomorrow when I shall feelbetter. I can’t say how glad I am to see you in person after all our many letters. Youhave the file with you, of course? And the kodak prints and record? Noyes put your valise inthe hall—I suppose you saw it. For tonight I fear you’ll have to wait on yourselfto a great extent. Your room is upstairs—the one over this—and you’ll seethe bathroom door open at the head of the staircase. There’s a meal spread for you inthe dining-room—right through this door at your right—which you can take wheneveryou feel like it. I’ll be a better host tomorrow—but just now weakness leaves mehelpless.
“Make yourself at home—you might take out the letters and picturesand record and put them on the table here before you go upstairs with your bag. It is here thatwe shall discuss them—you can see my phonograph on that corner stand.
“No, thanks—there’s nothing you can do for me. I know thesespells of old. Just come back for a little quiet visiting before night, and then go to bed whenyou please. I’ll rest right here—perhaps sleep here all night as I often do. Inthe morning I’ll be far better able to go into the things we must go into. You realise,of course, the utterly stupendous nature of the matter before us. To us, as to only a few menon this earth, there will be opened up gulfs of time and space and knowledge beyond anythingwithin the conception of human science and philosophy.
“Do you know that Einstein is wrong, and that certain objects and forcescan move with a velocity greater than that of light? With proper aid I expect to go backwardand forward in time, and actually see and feel the earth of remote past and futureepochs. You can’t imagine the degree to which those beings have carried science. Thereis nothing they can’t do with the mind and body of living organisms. I expect to visitother planets, and even other stars and galaxies. The first trip will be to Yuggoth, the nearestworld fully peopled by the beings. It is a strange dark orb at the very rim of our solar system—unknownto earthly astronomers as yet. But I must have written you about this. At the proper time, youknow, the beings there will direct thought-currents toward us and cause it to be discovered—orperhaps let one of their human allies give the scientists a hint.
“There are mighty cities on Yuggoth—great tiers of terraced towersbuilt of black stone like the specimen I tried to send you. That came from Yuggoth. The sunshines there no brighter than a star, but the beings need no light. They have other, subtlersenses, and put no windows in their great houses and temples. Light even hurts and hampers andconfuses them, for it does not exist at all in the black cosmos outside time and space wherethey came from originally. To visit Yuggoth would drive any weak man mad—yet I am goingthere. The black rivers of pitch that flow under those mysterious Cyclopean bridges—thingsbuilt by some elder race extinct and forgotten before the things came to Yuggoth from the ultimatevoids—ought to be enough to make any man a Dante or Poe if he can keep sane long enoughto tell what he has seen.
“But remember—that dark world of fungoid gardens and windowlesscities isn’t really terrible. It is only to us that it would seem so. Probably this worldseemed just as terrible to the beings when they first explored it in the primal age. You knowthey were here long before the fabulous epoch of Cthulhu was over, and remember all about sunkenR’lyeh when it was above the waters. They’ve been inside the earth, too—thereare openings which human beings know nothing of—some of them in these very Vermont hills—andgreat worlds of unknown life down there; blue-litten K’n-yan, red-litten Yoth, and black,lightless N’kai. It’s from N’kai that frightful Tsathoggua came—youknow, the amorphous, toad-like god-creature mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon and the Commoriom myth-cycle preserved by the Atlantean high-priest Klarkash-Ton.
“But we will talk of all this later on. It must be four or five o’clockby this time. Better bring the stuff from your bag, take a bite, and then come back for a comfortablechat.”
Very slowly I turned and began to obey my host; fetching my valise, extractingand depositing the desired articles, and finally ascending to the room designated as mine. Withthe memory of that roadside claw-print fresh in my mind, Akeley’s whispered paragraphshad affected me queerly; and the hints of familiarity with this unknown world of fungous life—forbiddenYuggoth—made my flesh creep more than I cared to own. I was tremendously sorry about Akeley’sillness, but had to confess that his hoarse whisper had a hateful as well as pitiful quality.If only he wouldn’t gloat so about Yuggoth and its black secrets!
My room proved a very pleasant and well-furnished one, devoid alike of themusty odour and disturbing sense of vibration; and after leaving my valise there I descendedagain to greet Akeley and take the lunch he had set out for me. The dining-room was just beyondthe study, and I saw that a kitchen ell extended still farther in the same direction. On thedining-table an ample array of sandwiches, cake, and cheese awaited me, and a Thermos-bottlebeside a cup and saucer testified that hot coffee had not been forgotten. After a well-relishedmeal I poured myself a liberal cup of coffee, but found that the culinary standard had suffereda lapse in this one detail. My first spoonful revealed a faintly unpleasant acrid taste, sothat I did not take more. Throughout the lunch I thought of Akeley sitting silently in the greatchair in the darkened next room. Once I went in to beg him to share the repast, but he whisperedthat he could eat nothing as yet. Later on, just before he slept, he would take some maltedmilk—all he ought to have that day.
After lunch I insisted on clearing the dishes away and washing them in thekitchen sink—incidentally emptying the coffee which I had not been able to appreciate.Then returning to the darkened study I drew up a chair near my host’s corner and preparedfor such conversation as he might feel inclined to conduct. The letters, pictures, and recordwere still on the large centre-table, but for the nonce we did not have to draw upon them. Beforelong I forgot even the bizarre odour and curious suggestions of vibration.
I have said that there were things in some of Akeley’s letters—especiallythe second and most voluminous one—which I would not dare to quote or even form into wordson paper. This hesitancy applies with still greater force to the things I heard whispered thatevening in the darkened room among the lonely haunted hills. Of the extent of the cosmic horrorsunfolded by that raucous voice I cannot even hint. He had known hideous things before, but whathe had learned since making his pact with the Outside Things was almost too much for sanityto bear. Even now I absolutely refuse to believe what he implied about the constitution of ultimateinfinity, the juxtaposition of dimensions, and the frightful position of our known cosmos ofspace and time in the unending chain of linked cosmos-atoms which makes up the immediate super-cosmosof curves, angles, and material and semi-material electronic organisation.
Never was a sane man more dangerously close to the arcana of basic entity—neverwas an organic brain nearer to utter annihilation in the chaos that transcends form and forceand symmetry. I learned whence Cthulhu first came, and why half the great temporary starsof history had flared forth. I guessed—from hints which made even my informant pause timidly—thesecret behind the Magellanic Clouds and globular nebulae, and the black truth veiled by theimmemorial allegory of Tao. The nature of the Doels was plainly revealed, and I was told theessence (though not the source) of the Hounds of Tindalos. The legend of Yig, Father of Serpents,remained figurative no longer, and I started with loathing when told of the monstrous nuclearchaos beyond angled space which the Necronomicon had mercifully cloaked under the nameof Azathoth. It was shocking to have the foulest nightmares of secret myth cleared up in concreteterms whose stark, morbid hatefulness exceeded the boldest hints of ancient and mediaeval mystics.Ineluctably I was led to believe that the first whisperers of these accursed tales must havehad discourse with Akeley’s Outer Ones, and perhaps have visited outer cosmic realms asAkeley now proposed visiting them.
I was told of the Black Stone and what it implied, and was glad that it hadnot reached me. My guesses about those hieroglyphics had been all too correct! And yet Akeleynow seemed reconciled to the whole fiendish system he had stumbled upon; reconciled and eagerto probe farther into the monstrous abyss. I wondered what beings he had talked with since hislast letter to me, and whether many of them had been as human as that first emissary he hadmentioned. The tension in my head grew insufferable, and I built up all sorts of wild theoriesabout the queer, persistent odour and those insidious hints of vibration in the darkened room.
Night was falling now, and as I recalled what Akeley had written me about thoseearlier nights I shuddered to think there would be no moon. Nor did I like the way the farmhousenestled in the lee of that colossal forested slope leading up to Dark Mountain’s unvisitedcrest. With Akeley’s permission I lighted a small oil lamp, turned it low, and set iton a distant bookcase beside the ghostly bust of Milton; but afterward I was sorry I had doneso, for it made my host’s strained, immobile face and listless hands look damnably abnormaland corpse-like. He seemed half-incapable of motion, though I saw him nod stiffly once in awhile.
After what he had told, I could scarcely imagine what profounder secrets hewas saving for the morrow; but at last it developed that his trip to Yuggoth and beyond—andmy own possible participation in it—was to be the next day’s topic. He musthave been amused by the start of horror I gave at hearing a cosmic voyage on my part proposed,for his head wabbled violently when I shewed my fear. Subsequently he spoke very gently of howhuman beings might accomplish—and several times had accomplished—the seemingly impossibleflight across the interstellar void. It seemed that complete human bodies did not indeedmake the trip, but that the prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skillof the Outer Ones had found a way to convey human brains without their concomitant physicalstructure.
There was a harmless way to extract a brain, and a way to keep the organicresidue alive during its absence. The bare, compact cerebral matter was then immersed in anoccasionally replenished fluid within an ether-tight cylinder of a metal mined in Yuggoth, certainelectrodes reaching through and connecting at will with elaborate instruments capable of duplicatingthe three vital faculties of sight, hearing, and speech. For the winged fungus-beings to carrythe brain-cylinders intact through space was an easy matter. Then, on every planet covered bytheir civilisation, they would find plenty of adjustable faculty-instruments capable of beingconnected with the encased brains; so that after a little fitting these travelling intelligencescould be given a full sensory and articulate life—albeit a bodiless and mechanical one—ateach stage of their journeying through and beyond the space-time continuum. It was as simpleas carrying a phonograph record about and playing it wherever a phonograph of the correspondingmake exists. Of its success there could be no question. Akeley was not afraid. Had it not beenbrilliantly accomplished again and again?
For the first time one of the inert, wasted hands raised itself and pointedto a high shelf on the farther side of the room. There, in a neat row, stood more thana dozen cylinders of a metal I had never seen before—cylinders about a foot high and somewhatless in diameter, with three curious sockets set in an isosceles triangle over the front convexsurface of each. One of them was linked at two of the sockets to a pair of singular-lookingmachines that stood in the background. Of their purport I did not need to be told, and I shiveredas with ague. Then I saw the hand point to a much nearer corner where some intricate instrumentswith attached cords and plugs, several of them much like the two devices on the shelf behindthe cylinders, were huddled together.
“There are four kinds of instruments here, Wilmarth,” whisperedthe voice. “Four kinds—three faculties each—makes twelve pieces in all. Yousee there are four different sorts of beings presented in those cylinders up there. Three humans,six fungoid beings who can’t navigate space corporeally, two beings from Neptune (God!if you could see the body this type has on its own planet!), and the rest entities from thecentral caverns of an especially interesting dark star beyond the galaxy. In the principal outpostinside Round Hill you’ll now and then find more cylinders and machines—cylindersof extra-cosmic brains with different senses from any we know—allies and explorers fromthe uttermost Outside—and special machines for giving them impressions and expressionin the several ways suited at once to them and to the comprehensions of different types of listeners.Round Hill, like most of the beings’ main outposts all through the various universes,is a very cosmopolitan place! Of course, only the more common types have been lent to me forexperiment.
“Here—take the three machines I point to and set them on the table.That tall one with the two glass lenses in front—then the box with the vacuum tubes andsounding-board—and now the one with the metal disc on top. Now for the cylinder with thelabel ‘B-67’ pasted on it. Just stand in that Windsor chair to reach the shelf.Heavy? Never mind! Be sure of the number—B-67. Don’t bother that fresh, shiny cylinderjoined to the two testing instruments—the one with my name on it. Set B-67 on the tablenear where you’ve put the machines—and see that the dial switch on all three machinesis jammed over to the extreme left.
“Now connect the cord of the lens machine with the upper socket on thecylinder—there! Join the tube machine to the lower left-hand socket, and the disc apparatusto the outer socket. Now move all the dial switches on the machines over to the extreme right—firstthe lens one, then the disc one, and then the tube one. That’s right. I might as welltell you that this is a human being—just like any of us. I’ll give you a taste ofsome of the others tomorrow.”
To this day I do not know why I obeyed those whispers so slavishly, or whetherI thought Akeley was mad or sane. After what had gone before, I ought to have been preparedfor anything; but this mechanical mummery seemed so like the typical vagaries of crazed inventorsand scientists that it struck a chord of doubt which even the preceding discourse had not excited.What the whisperer implied was beyond all human belief—yet were not the other things stillfarther beyond, and less preposterous only because of their remoteness from tangible concreteproof?
As my mind reeled amidst this chaos, I became conscious of a mixed gratingand whirring from all three machines lately linked to the cylinder—a grating andwhirring which soon subsided into a virtual noiselessness. What was about to happen? Was I tohear a voice? And if so, what proof would I have that it was not some cleverly concocted radiodevice talked into by a concealed but closely watching speaker? Even now I am unwilling to swearjust what I heard, or just what phenomenon really took place before me. But something certainlyseemed to take place.
To be brief and plain, the machine with the tubes and sound-box began to speak,and with a point and intelligence which left no doubt that the speaker was actually presentand observing us. The voice was loud, metallic, lifeless, and plainly mechanical in every detailof its production. It was incapable of inflection or expressiveness, but scraped and rattledon with a deadly precision and deliberation.
“Mr. Wilmarth,” it said, “I hope I do not startle you. Iam a human being like yourself, though my body is now resting safely under proper vitalisingtreatment inside Round Hill, about a mile and a half east of here. I myself am here with you—mybrain is in that cylinder and I see, hear, and speak through these electronic vibrators. Ina week I am going across the void as I have been many times before, and I expect to have thepleasure of Mr. Akeley’s company. I wish I might have yours as well; for I know you bysight and reputation, and have kept close track of your correspondence with our friend. I am,of course, one of the men who have become allied with the outside beings visiting our planet.I met them first in the Himalayas, and have helped them in various ways. In return they havegiven me experiences such as few men have ever had.
“Do you realise what it means when I say I have been on thirty-sevendifferent celestial bodies—planets, dark stars, and less definable objects—includingeight outside our galaxy and two outside the curved cosmos of space and time? All this has notharmed me in the least. My brain has been removed from my body by fissions so adroit that itwould be crude to call the operation surgery. The visiting beings have methods which make theseextractions easy and almost normal—and one’s body never ages when the brain is outof it. The brain, I may add, is virtually immortal with its mechanical faculties and a limitednourishment supplied by occasional changes of the preserving fluid.
“Altogether, I hope most heartily that you will decide to come with Mr.Akeley and me. The visitors are eager to know men of knowledge like yourself, and to shew themthe great abysses that most of us have had to dream about in fanciful ignorance. It may seemstrange at first to meet them, but I know you will be above minding that. I think Mr. Noyeswill go along, too—the man who doubtless brought you up here in his car. He has been oneof us for years—I suppose you recognised his voice as one of those on the record Mr. Akeleysent you.”
At my violent start the speaker paused a moment before concluding.
“So, Mr. Wilmarth, I will leave the matter to you; merely adding thata man with your love of strangeness and folklore ought never to miss such a chance as this.There is nothing to fear. All transitions are painless, and there is much to enjoy in a whollymechanised state of sensation. When the electrodes are disconnected, one merely drops off intoa sleep of especially vivid and fantastic dreams.
“And now, if you don’t mind, we might adjourn our session tilltomorrow. Good night—just turn all the switches back to the left; never mind the exactorder, though you might let the lens machine be last. Good night, Mr. Akeley—treat ourguest well! Ready now with those switches?”
That was all. I obeyed mechanically and shut off all three switches, thoughdazed with doubt of everything that had occurred. My head was still reeling as I heard Akeley’swhispering voice telling me that I might leave all the apparatus on the table just as it was.He did not essay any comment on what had happened, and indeed no comment could have conveyedmuch to my burdened faculties. I heard him telling me I could take the lamp to use in my room,and deduced that he wished to rest alone in the dark. It was surely time he rested, for hisdiscourse of the afternoon and evening had been such as to exhaust even a vigorous man. Stilldazed, I bade my host good night and went upstairs with the lamp, although I had an excellentpocket flashlight with me.
I was glad to be out of that downstairs study with the queer odour and vaguesuggestions of vibration, yet could not of course escape a hideous sense of dread and periland cosmic abnormality as I thought of the place I was in and the forces I was meeting. Thewild, lonely region, the black, mysteriously forested slope towering so close behind the house,the footprints in the road, the sick, motionless whisperer in the dark, the hellish cylindersand machines, and above all the invitations to strange surgery and stranger voyagings—thesethings, all so new and in such sudden succession, rushed in on me with a cumulative force whichsapped my will and almost undermined my physical strength.
To discover that my guide Noyes was the human celebrant in that monstrous bygoneSabbat-ritual on the phonograph record was a particular shock, though I had previously senseda dim, repellent familiarity in his voice. Another special shock came from my own attitude towardmy host whenever I paused to analyse it; for much as I had instinctively liked Akeley as revealedin his correspondence, I now found that he filled me with a distinct repulsion. His illnessought to have excited my pity; but instead, it gave me a kind of shudder. He was so rigid andinert and corpse-like—and that incessant whispering was so hateful and unhuman!
It occurred to me that this whispering was different from anything else ofthe kind I had ever heard; that, despite the curious motionlessness of the speaker’s moustache-screenedlips, it had a latent strength and carrying-power remarkable for the wheezings of an asthmatic.I had been able to understand the speaker when wholly across the room, and once or twice ithad seemed to me that the faint but penetrant sounds represented not so much weakness as deliberaterepression—for what reason I could not guess. From the first I had felt a disturbing qualityin their timbre. Now, when I tried to weigh the matter, I thought I could trace this impressionto a kind of subconscious familiarity like that which had made Noyes’s voice so hazilyominous. But when or where I had encountered the thing it hinted at, was more than I could tell.
One thing was certain—I would not spend another night here. My scientificzeal had vanished amidst fear and loathing, and I felt nothing now but a wish to escape fromthis net of morbidity and unnatural revelation. I knew enough now. It must indeed be true thatcosmic linkages do exist—but such things are surely not meant for normal human beingsto meddle with.
Blasphemous influences seemed to surround me and press chokingly upon my senses.Sleep, I decided, would be out of the question; so I merely extinguished the lamp and threwmyself on the bed fully dressed. No doubt it was absurd, but I kept ready for some unknown emergency;gripping in my right hand the revolver I had brought along, and holding the pocket flashlightin my left. Not a sound came from below, and I could imagine how my host was sitting there withcadaverous stiffness in the dark.
Somewhere I heard a clock ticking, and was vaguely grateful for the normalityof the sound. It reminded me, though, of another thing about the region which disturbed me—thetotal absence of animal life. There were certainly no farm beasts about, and now I realisedthat even the accustomed night-noises of wild living things were absent. Except for the sinistertrickle of distant unseen waters, that stillness was anomalous—interplanetary—andI wondered what star-spawned, intangible blight could be hanging over the region. I recalledfrom old legends that dogs and other beasts had always hated the Outer Ones, and thought ofwhat those tracks in the road might mean.

VIII.

Do not ask me how long my unexpected lapse into slumber lasted, or how muchof what ensued was sheer dream. If I tell you that I awaked at a certain time, and heard andsaw certain things, you will merely answer that I did not wake then; and that everything wasa dream until the moment when I rushed out of the house, stumbled to the shed where I had seenthe old Ford, and seized that ancient vehicle for a mad, aimless race over the haunted hillswhich at last landed me—after hours of jolting and winding through forest-threatened labyrinths—ina village which turned out to be Townshend.
You will also, of course, discount everything else in my report; and declarethat all the pictures, record-sounds, cylinder-and-machine sounds, and kindred evidences werebits of pure deception practiced on me by the missing Henry Akeley. You will even hint thathe conspired with other eccentrics to carry out a silly and elaborate hoax—that he hadthe express shipment removed at Keene, and that he had Noyes make that terrifying wax record.It is odd, though, that Noyes has not even yet been identified; that he was unknown at any ofthe villages near Akeley’s place, though he must have been frequently in the region. Iwish I had stopped to memorise the licence-number of his car—or perhaps it is better afterall that I did not. For I, despite all you can say, and despite all I sometimes try to say tomyself, know that loathsome outside influences must be lurking there in the half-unknown hills—andthat those influences have spies and emissaries in the world of men. To keep as far as possiblefrom such influences and such emissaries is all that I ask of life in future.
When my frantic story sent a sheriff’s posse out to the farmhouse, Akeleywas gone without leaving a trace. His loose dressing-gown, yellow scarf, and foot-bandages layon the study floor near his corner easy-chair, and it could not be decided whether any of hisother apparel had vanished with him. The dogs and livestock were indeed missing, and there weresome curious bullet-holes both on the house’s exterior and on some of the walls within;but beyond this nothing unusual could be detected. No cylinders or machines, none of the evidencesI had brought in my valise, no queer odour or vibration-sense, no footprints in the road, andnone of the problematical things I glimpsed at the very last.
I stayed a week in Brattleboro after my escape, making inquiries among peopleof every kind who had known Akeley; and the results convince me that the matter is no figmentof dream or delusion. Akeley’s queer purchases of dogs and ammunition and chemicals, andthe cutting of his telephone wires, are matters of record; while all who knew him—includinghis son in California—concede that his occasional remarks on strange studies had a certainconsistency. Solid citizens believe he was mad, and unhesitatingly pronounce all reported evidencesmere hoaxes devised with insane cunning and perhaps abetted by eccentric associates; but thelowlier country folk sustain his statements in every detail. He had shewed some of these rusticshis photographs and black stone, and had played the hideous record for them; and they all saidthe footprints and buzzing voice were like those described in ancestral legends.
They said, too, that suspicious sights and sounds had been noticed increasinglyaround Akeley’s house after he found the black stone, and that the place was now avoidedby everybody except the mail man and other casual, tough-minded people. Dark Mountain and RoundHill were both notoriously haunted spots, and I could find no one who had ever closely exploredeither. Occasional disappearances of natives throughout the district’s history were wellattested, and these now included the semi-vagabond Walter Brown, whom Akeley’s lettershad mentioned. I even came upon one farmer who thought he had personally glimpsed one of thequeer bodies at flood-time in the swollen West River, but his tale was too confused to be reallyvaluable.
When I left Brattleboro I resolved never to go back to Vermont, and I feelquite certain I shall keep my resolution. Those wild hills are surely the outpost of a frightfulcosmic race—as I doubt all the less since reading that a new ninth planet has been glimpsedbeyond Neptune, just as those influences had said it would be glimpsed. Astronomers, with ahideous appropriateness they little suspect, have named this thing “Pluto”. I feel,beyond question, that it is nothing less than nighted Yuggoth—and I shiver when I tryto figure out the real reason why its monstrous denizens wish it to be known in thisway at this especial time. I vainly try to assure myself that these daemoniac creatures arenot gradually leading up to some new policy hurtful to the earth and its normal inhabitants.
But I have still to tell of the ending of that terrible night in the farmhouse.As I have said, I did finally drop into a troubled doze; a doze filled with bits of dream whichinvolved monstrous landscape-glimpses. Just what awaked me I cannot yet say, but that I didindeed awake at this given point I feel very certain. My first confused impression was of stealthilycreaking floor-boards in the hall outside my door, and of a clumsy, muffled fumbling at thelatch. This, however, ceased almost at once; so that my really clear impressions began withthe voices heard from the study below. There seemed to be several speakers, and I judged thatthey were controversially engaged.
By the time I had listened a few seconds I was broad awake, for the natureof the voices was such as to make all thought of sleep ridiculous. The tones were curiouslyvaried, and no one who had listened to that accursed phonograph record could harbour any doubtsabout the nature of at least two of them. Hideous though the idea was, I knew that I was underthe same roof with nameless things from abysmal space; for those two voices were unmistakablythe blasphemous buzzings which the Outside Beings used in their communication with men. Thetwo were individually different—different in pitch, accent, and tempo—but they wereboth of the same damnable general kind.
A third voice was indubitably that of a mechanical utterance-machine connectedwith one of the detached brains in the cylinders. There was as little doubt about that as aboutthe buzzings; for the loud, metallic, lifeless voice of the previous evening, with its inflectionless,expressionless scraping and rattling, and its impersonal precision and deliberation, had beenutterly unforgettable. For a time I did not pause to question whether the intelligence behindthe scraping was the identical one which had formerly talked to me; but shortly afterward Ireflected that any brain would emit vocal sounds of the same quality if linked to thesame mechanical speech-producer; the only possible differences being in language, rhythm, speed,and pronunciation. To complete the eldritch colloquy there were two actually human voices—onethe crude speech of an unknown and evidently rustic man, and the other the suave Bostonian tonesof my erstwhile guide Noyes.
As I tried to catch the words which the stoutly fashioned floor so bafflinglyintercepted, I was also conscious of a great deal of stirring and scratching and shuffling inthe room below; so that I could not escape the impression that it was full of living beings—manymore than the few whose speech I could single out. The exact nature of this stirring is extremelyhard to describe, for very few good bases of comparison exist. Objects seemed now and then tomove across the room like conscious entities; the sound of their footfalls having somethingabout it like a loose, hard-surfaced clattering—as of the contact of ill-coördinatedsurfaces of horn or hard rubber. It was, to use a more concrete but less accurate comparison,as if people with loose, splintery wooden shoes were shambling and rattling about on the polishedboard floor. On the nature and appearance of those responsible for the sounds, I did not careto speculate.
Before long I saw that it would be impossible to distinguish any connecteddiscourse. Isolated words—including the names of Akeley and myself—now and thenfloated up, especially when uttered by the mechanical speech-producer; but their true significancewas lost for want of continuous context. Today I refuse to form any definite deductions fromthem, and even their frightful effect on me was one of suggestion rather than of revelation.A terrible and abnormal conclave, I felt certain, was assembled below me; but for what shockingdeliberations I could not tell. It was curious how this unquestioned sense of the malign andthe blasphemous pervaded me despite Akeley’s assurances of the Outsiders’ friendliness.
With patient listening I began to distinguish clearly between voices, eventhough I could not grasp much of what any of the voices said. I seemed to catch certain typicalemotions behind some of the speakers. One of the buzzing voices, for example, held an unmistakablenote of authority; whilst the mechanical voice, notwithstanding its artificial loudness andregularity, seemed to be in a position of subordination and pleading. Noyes’s tones exudeda kind of conciliatory atmosphere. The others I could make no attempt to interpret. I did nothear the familiar whisper of Akeley, but well knew that such a sound could never penetrate thesolid flooring of my room.
I will try to set down some of the few disjointed words and other sounds Icaught, labelling the speakers of the words as best I know how. It was from the speech-machinethat I first picked up a few recognisable phrases.

(THE SPEECH-MACHINE)

“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brought it on myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sent backthe letters and the record&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. end on it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. taken in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.seeing and hearing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. damn you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. impersonal force, afterall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fresh, shiny cylinder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. great God.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”

(FIRST BUZZING VOICE)

(SECOND BUZZING VOICE)

“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nyarlathotep&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wilmarth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.records and letters&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cheap imposture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”

“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all yours&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.down here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”

(SEVERAL VOICES AT ONCE IN INDISTINGUISHABLE SPEECH)


(MANY FOOTSTEPS, INCLUDING THE PECULIAR LOOSE STIRRING OR CLATTERING)


(A CURIOUS SORT OF FLAPPING SOUND)


(THE SOUND OF AN AUTOMOBILE STARTING AND RECEDING)


(SILENCE)
That is the substance of what my ears brought me as I lay rigid upon that strangeupstairs bed in the haunted farmhouse among the daemoniac hills—lay there fully dressed,with a revolver clenched in my right hand and a pocket flashlight gripped in my left. I became,as I have said, broad awake; but a kind of obscure paralysis nevertheless kept me inert tilllong after the last echoes of the sounds had died away. I heard the wooden, deliberate tickingof the ancient Connecticut clock somewhere far below, and at last made out the irregular snoringof a sleeper. Akeley must have dozed off after the strange session, and I could well believethat he needed to do so.
Just what to think or what to do was more than I could decide. After all, whathad I heard beyond things which previous information might have led me to expect? HadI not known that the nameless Outsiders were now freely admitted to the farmhouse? No doubtAkeley had been surprised by an unexpected visit from them. Yet something in that fragmentarydiscourse had chilled me immeasurably, raised the most grotesque and horrible doubts, and mademe wish fervently that I might wake up and prove everything a dream. I think my subconsciousmind must have caught something which my consciousness has not yet recognised. But what of Akeley?Was he not my friend, and would he not have protested if any harm were meant me? The peacefulsnoring below seemed to cast ridicule on all my suddenly intensified fears.
Was it possible that Akeley had been imposed upon and used as a lure to drawme into the hills with the letters and pictures and phonograph record? Did those beings meanto engulf us both in a common destruction because we had come to know too much? Again I thoughtof the abruptness and unnaturalness of that change in the situation which must have occurredbetween Akeley’s penultimate and final letters. Something, my instinct told me, was terriblywrong. All was not as it seemed. That acrid coffee which I refused—had there not beenan attempt by some hidden, unknown entity to drug it? I must talk to Akeley at once, and restorehis sense of proportion. They had hypnotised him with their promises of cosmic revelations,but now he must listen to reason. We must get out of this before it would be too late. If helacked the will power to make the break for liberty, I would supply it. Or if I could not persuadehim to go, I could at least go myself. Surely he would let me take his Ford and leave it ina garage at Brattleboro. I had noticed it in the shed—the door being left unlocked andopen now that peril was deemed past—and I believed there was a good chance of its beingready for instant use. That momentary dislike of Akeley which I had felt during and after theevening’s conversation was all gone now. He was in a position much like my own, and wemust stick together. Knowing his indisposed condition, I hated to wake him at this juncture,but I knew that I must. I could not stay in this place till morning as matters stood.
At last I felt able to act, and stretched myself vigorously to regain commandof my muscles. Arising with a caution more impulsive than deliberate, I found and donned myhat, took my valise, and started downstairs with the flashlight’s aid. In my nervousnessI kept the revolver clutched in my right hand, being able to take care of both valise and flashlightwith my left. Why I exerted these precautions I do not really know, since I was even then onmy way to awaken the only other occupant of the house.
As I half tiptoed down the creaking stairs to the lower hall I could hear thesleeper more plainly, and noticed that he must be in the room on my left—the living-roomI had not entered. On my right was the gaping blackness of the study in which I had heard thevoices. Pushing open the unlatched door of the living-room I traced a path with the flashlighttoward the source of the snoring, and finally turned the beams on the sleeper’s face.But in the next second I hastily turned them away and commenced a cat-like retreat to the hall,my caution this time springing from reason as well as from instinct. For the sleeper on thecouch was not Akeley at all, but my quondam guide Noyes.
Just what the real situation was, I could not guess; but common sense toldme that the safest thing was to find out as much as possible before arousing anybody. Regainingthe hall, I silently closed and latched the living-room door after me; thereby lessening thechances of awaking Noyes. I now cautiously entered the dark study, where I expected to findAkeley, whether asleep or awake, in the great corner chair which was evidently his favouriteresting-place. As I advanced, the beams of my flashlight caught the great centre-table, revealingone of the hellish cylinders with sight and hearing machines attached, and with a speech-machinestanding close by, ready to be connected at any moment. This, I reflected, must be the encasedbrain I had heard talking during the frightful conference; and for a second I had a perverseimpulse to attach the speech-machine and see what it would say.
It must, I thought, be conscious of my presence even now; since the sight andhearing attachments could not fail to disclose the rays of my flashlight and the faint creakingof the floor beneath my feet. But in the end I did not dare meddle with the thing. I idly sawthat it was the fresh, shiny cylinder with Akeley’s name on it, which I had noticed onthe shelf earlier in the evening and which my host had told me not to bother. Looking back atthat moment, I can only regret my timidity and wish that I had boldly caused the apparatus tospeak. God knows what mysteries and horrible doubts and questions of identity it might havecleared up! But then, it may be merciful that I let it alone.
From the table I turned my flashlight to the corner where I thought Akeleywas, but found to my perplexity that the great easy-chair was empty of any human occupant asleepor awake. From the seat to the floor there trailed voluminously the familiar old dressing-gown,and near it on the floor lay the yellow scarf and the huge foot-bandages I had thought so odd.As I hesitated, striving to conjecture where Akeley might be, and why he had so suddenly discardedhis necessary sick-room garments, I observed that the queer odour and sense of vibration wereno longer in the room. What had been their cause? Curiously it occurred to me that I had noticedthem only in Akeley’s vicinity. They had been strongest where he sat, and wholly absentexcept in the room with him or just outside the doors of that room. I paused, letting the flashlightwander about the dark study and racking my brain for explanations of the turn affairs had taken.
Would to heaven I had quietly left the place before allowing that light torest again on the vacant chair. As it turned out, I did not leave quietly; but with a muffledshriek which must have disturbed, though it did not quite awake, the sleeping sentinel acrossthe hall. That shriek, and Noyes’s still-unbroken snore, are the last sounds I ever heardin that morbidity-choked farmhouse beneath the black-wooded crest of a haunted mountain—thatfocus of trans-cosmic horror amidst the lonely green hills and curse-muttering brooks of a spectralrustic land.
It is a wonder that I did not drop flashlight, valise, and revolver in my wildscramble, but somehow I failed to lose any of these. I actually managed to get out of that roomand that house without making any further noise, to drag myself and my belongings safely intothe old Ford in the shed, and to set that archaic vehicle in motion toward some unknown pointof safety in the black, moonless night. The ride that followed was a piece of delirium out ofPoe or Rimbaud or the drawings of Doré, but finally I reached Townshend. That is all.If my sanity is still unshaken, I am lucky. Sometimes I fear what the years will bring, especiallysince that new planet Pluto has been so curiously discovered.
As I have implied, I let my flashlight return to the vacant easy-chair afterits circuit of the room; then noticing for the first time the presence of certain objects inthe seat, made inconspicuous by the adjacent loose folds of the empty dressing-gown. These arethe objects, three in number, which the investigators did not find when they came later on.As I said at the outset, there was nothing of actual visual horror about them. The trouble wasin what they led one to infer. Even now I have my moments of half-doubt—moments in whichI half accept the scepticism of those who attribute my whole experience to dream and nervesand delusion.
The three things were damnably clever constructions of their kind, and werefurnished with ingenious metallic clamps to attach them to organic developments of which I darenot form any conjecture. I hope—devoutly hope—that they were the waxen productsof a master artist, despite what my inmost fears tell me. Great God! That whisperer in darknesswith its morbid odour and vibrations! Sorcerer, emissary, changeling, outsider&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.that hideous repressed buzzing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all the time in that fresh, shiny cylinderon the shelf&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. poor devil&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “prodigious surgical,biological, chemical, and mechanical skill”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
For the things in the chair, perfect to the last, subtle detail of microscopicresemblance—or identity—were the face and hands of Henry Wentworth Akeley.
