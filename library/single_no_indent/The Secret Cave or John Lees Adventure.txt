As Soon as The Elder Lees were away the younger Lees went down cellar &amp;began to rummage among the rubbish little alice leaned against the wall watching John. As Johnwas making a boat of barrel staves the Little girl gave a piercing cry as the bricks behindher crumbled away he rushed up to her &amp; Lifted her out screaming loudly as soon as her screamssubsided she said “the wall went away” John went up &amp; saw that there was a passagehe said to the little girl “lets come &amp; see what this is” “Yes”she said the entered the place they could stand up it the passage was farther than they couldsee they John went back upstairs &amp; went to the kitchen drawer &amp; got 2 candles &amp;some matches &amp; then they went back to the cellar passage. the two once more entered therewas plastering on the walls ceiling &amp; floor nothing was visible but a box this was for aseat nevertheless they examined it &amp; found it to contain nothing the walked on farther &amp;pretty soon the plastering left off &amp; they were in a cave Little alice was frightened atfirst but at her brothers assurance that it was “all right” she allayed her fears.soon they came to a small box which John took up &amp; carried within pretty soon they cameon a boat in it were two oars he dragged it with difficulty along with him soon theyfound the passage came to an abrupt stop he pulled the obstacle away &amp; to his dismay waterrushed in in torrents John was an expert swimmer &amp; long breathede he had Just taken a breathso he tried to rise but with the box &amp; his sister he found it quite impossible then he caughtsight of the boat rising he grasped it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The next he knew he was on the surface clinging tightly to the body of his sister &amp; themysterious box he could not imagine how the water got in but a new peril menaced them if thewater continued rising it would rise to the top suddenly a thought presented itself. he couldshut off the water he speedily did this &amp; lifting the now lifeless body of his sister intothe boat he himself climed in &amp; sailed down the passage it was gruesome &amp; uncanny absolutelydark his candle being put out by the flood &amp; a dead body lying near he did not gaze abouthim but rowed for his life when he did look up he was floating in his own cellar he quicklyrushed up stairs with the body, to find his parents had come home He told them the story

The funeral of alice occupied so much time that John quite forgot about thebox—but when they did open it they found it to be a solid gold chunk worthabout $10,000 enough to pay for any thing but the death of his sister.
