I.

Few persons know the inside of the Clarendon story, or even that there is an inside not reachedby the newspapers. It was a San Francisco sensation in the days before the fire, both becauseof the panic and menace that kept it company, and because of its close linkage with the governorof the state. Governor Dalton, it will be recalled, was Clarendon’s best friend, and latermarried his sister. Neither Dalton nor Mrs. Dalton would ever discuss the painful affair, butsomehow the facts have leaked out to a limited circle. But for that and for the years whichhave given a sort of vagueness and impersonality to the actors, one would still pause beforeprobing into secrets so strictly guarded at the time.
The appointment of Dr. Alfred Clarendon as medical director of San QuentinPenitentiary in 189- was greeted with the keenest enthusiasm throughout California. San Franciscohad at last the honour of harbouring one of the greatest biologists and physicians of the period,and solid pathological leaders from all over the world might be expected to flock thither tostudy his methods, profit by his advice and researches, and learn how to cope with their ownlocal problems. California, almost over night, would become a centre of medical scholarshipwith earthwide influence and reputation.
Governor Dalton, anxious to spread the news in its fullest significance, sawto it that the press carried ample and dignified accounts of his new appointee. Pictures ofDr. Clarendon and his new home near old Goat Hill, sketches of his career and manifold honours,and popular accounts of his salient scientific discoveries were all presented in the principalCalifornia dailies, till the public soon felt a sort of reflected pride in the man whose studiesof pyemia in India, of the pest in China, and of every sort of kindred disorder elsewhere wouldsoon enrich the world of medicine with an antitoxin of revolutionary importance—a basicantitoxin combating the whole febrile principle at its very source, and ensuring the ultimateconquest and extirpation of fever in all its diverse forms.
Back of the appointment stretched an extended and not wholly unromantic historyof early friendship, long separation, and dramatically renewed acquaintance. James Dalton andthe Clarendon family had been friends in New York ten years before—friends and more thanfriends, since the doctor’s only sister, Georgina, was the sweetheart of Dalton’syouth, while the doctor himself had been his closest associate and almost his protégéin the days of school and college. The father of Alfred and Georgina, a Wall Street pirate ofthe ruthless elder breed, had known Dalton’s father well; so well, indeed, that he hadfinally stripped him of all he possessed in a memorable afternoon’s fight on the stockexchange. Dalton Senior, hopeless of recuperation and wishing to give his one adored child thebenefit of his insurance, had promptly blown out his brains; but James had not sought to retaliate.It was, as he viewed it, all in the game; and he wished no harm to the father of the girl hemeant to marry and of the budding young scientist whose admirer and protector he had been throughouttheir years of fellowship and study. Instead, he turned to the law, established himself in asmall way, and in due course of time asked “Old Clarendon” for Georgina’s hand.
Old Clarendon had refused very firmly and loudly, vowing that no pauper andupstart lawyer was fit to be his son-in-law; and a scene of considerable violence had occurred.James, telling the wrinkled freebooter at last what he ought to have been told long before,had left the house and the city in a high temper; and was embarked within a month upon the Californialife which was to lead him to the governorship through many a fight with ring and politician.His farewells to Alfred and Georgina had been brief, and he had never known the aftermath ofthat scene in the Clarendon library. Only by a day did he miss the news of Old Clarendon’sdeath from apoplexy, and by so missing it, changed the course of his whole career. He had notwritten Georgina in the decade that followed; knowing her loyalty to her father, and waitingtill his own fortune and position might remove all obstacles to the match. Nor had he sent anyword to Alfred, whose calm indifference in the face of affection and hero-worship had alwayssavoured of conscious destiny and the self-sufficiency of genius. Secure in the ties of a constancyrare even then, he had worked and risen with thoughts only of the future; still a bachelor,and with a perfect intuitive faith that Georgina also was waiting.
In this faith Dalton was not deceived. Wondering perhaps why no message evercame, Georgina found no romance save in her dreams and expectations; and in the course of timebecame busy with the new responsibilities brought by her brother’s rise to greatness. Alfred’sgrowth had not belied the promise of his youth, and the slim boy had darted quietly up the stepsof science with a speed and permanence almost dizzying to contemplate. Lean and ascetic, withsteel-rimmed pince-nez and pointed brown beard, Dr. Alfred Clarendon was an authority at twenty-fiveand an international figure at thirty. Careless of worldly affairs with the negligence of genius,he depended vastly on the care and management of his sister, and was secretly thankful thather memories of James had kept her from other and more tangible alliances.
Georgina conducted the business and household of the great bacteriologist,and was proud of his strides toward the conquest of fever. She bore patiently with his eccentricities,calmed his occasional bursts of fanaticism, and healed those breaches with his friends whichnow and then resulted from his unconcealed scorn of anything less than a single-minded devotionto pure truth and its progress. Clarendon was undeniably irritating at times to ordinary folk;for he never tired of depreciating the service of the individual as contrasted with the serviceof mankind as a whole, and in censuring men of learning who mingled domestic life or outsideinterests with their pursuit of abstract science. His enemies called him a bore; but his admirers,pausing before the white heat of ecstasy into which he would work himself, became almost ashamedof ever having any standards or aspirations outside the one divine sphere of unalloyed knowledge.
The doctor’s travels were extensive and Georgina generally accompaniedhim on the shorter ones. Three times, however, he had taken long, lone jaunts to strange anddistant places in his studies of exotic fevers and half-fabulous plagues; for he knew that itis out of the unknown lands of cryptic and immemorial Asia that most of the earth’s diseasesspring. On each of these occasions he had brought back curious mementoes which added to theeccentricity of his home, not least among which was the needlessly large staff of Thibetan servantspicked up somewhere in U-tsang during an epidemic of which the world never heard, but amidstwhich Clarendon had discovered and isolated the germ of black fever. These men, taller thanmost Thibetans and clearly belonging to a stock but little investigated in the outside world,were of a skeletonic leanness which made one wonder whether the doctor had sought to symbolisein them the anatomical models of his college years. Their aspect, in the loose black silk robesof Bonpa priests which he chose to give them, was grotesque in the highest degree; and therewas an unsmiling silence and stiffness in their motions which enhanced their air of fantasyand gave Georgina a queer, awed feeling of having stumbled into the pages of Vathek orthe Arabian Nights.
But queerest of all was the general factotum or clinic-man, whom Clarendonaddressed as Surama, and whom he had brought back with him after a long stay in Northern Africa,during which he had studied certain odd intermittent fevers among the mysterious Saharan Tuaregs,whose descent from the primal race of lost Atlantis is an old archaeological rumour. Surama,a man of great intelligence and seemingly inexhaustible erudition, was as morbidly lean as theThibetan servants; with swarthy, parchment-like skin drawn so tightly over his bald pate andhairless face that every line of the skull stood out in ghastly prominence—this death’s-headeffect being heightened by lustrelessly burning black eyes set with a depth which left to commonvisibility only a pair of dark, vacant sockets. Unlike the ideal subordinate, he seemed despitehis impassive features to spend no effort in concealing such emotions as he possessed. Instead,he carried about an insidious atmosphere of irony or amusement, accompanied at certain momentsby a deep, guttural chuckle like that of a giant turtle which has just torn to pieces some furryanimal and is ambling away toward the sea. His race appeared to be Caucasian, but could notbe classified more closely than that. Some of Clarendon’s friends thought he looked likea high-caste Hindoo notwithstanding his accentless speech, while many agreed with Georgina—whodisliked him—when she gave her opinion that a Pharaoh’s mummy, if miraculously broughtto life, would form a very apt twin for this sardonic skeleton.
Dalton, absorbed in his uphill political battles and isolated from Easterninterests through the peculiar self-sufficiency of the old West, had not followed the meteoricrise of his former comrade; Clarendon had actually heard nothing of one so far outside his chosenworld of science as the governor. Being of independent and even of abundant means, the Clarendonshad for many years stuck to their old Manhattan mansion in East Nineteenth Street, whose ghostsmust have looked sorely askance at the bizarrerie of Surama and the Thibetans. Then, throughthe doctor’s wish to transfer his base of medical observation, the great change had suddenlycome, and they had crossed the continent to take up a secluded life in San Francisco; buyingthe gloomy old Bannister place near Goat Hill, overlooking the bay, and establishing their strangehousehold in a rambling, French-roofed relic of mid-Victorian design and gold-rush parvenu display,set amidst high-walled grounds in a region still half suburban.
Dr. Clarendon, though better satisfied than in New York, still felt crampedfor lack of opportunities to apply and test his pathological theories. Unworldly as he was,he had never thought of using his reputation as an influence to gain public appointment; thoughmore and more he realised that only the medical directorship of a government or a charitableinstitution—a prison, almshouse, or hospital—would give him a field of sufficientwidth to complete his researches and make his discoveries of the greatest use to humanity andscience at large.
Then he had run into James Dalton by sheer accident one afternoon in MarketStreet as the governor was swinging out of the Royal Hotel. Georgina had been with him, andan almost instant recognition had heightened the drama of the reunion. Mutual ignorance of oneanother’s progress had bred long explanation and histories, and Clarendon was pleased tofind that he had so important an official for a friend. Dalton and Georgina, exchanging manya glance, felt more than a trace of their youthful tenderness; and a friendship was then andthere revived which led to frequent calls and a fuller and fuller exchange of confidences.
James Dalton learned of his old protégé’s need for politicalappointment, and sought, true to his protective role of school and college days, to devise somemeans of giving “Little Alf” the needed position and scope. He had, it is true, wideappointive powers; but the legislature’s constant attacks and encroachments forced himto exercise these with the utmost discretion. At length, however, scarcely three months afterthe sudden reunion, the foremost institutional medical office in the state fell vacant. Weighingall the elements with care, and conscious that his friend’s achievements and reputationwould justify the most substantial rewards, the governor felt at last able to act. Formalitieswere few, and on the eighth of November, 189-, Dr. Alfred Schuyler Clarendon became medicaldirector of the California State Penitentiary at San Quentin.

II.

In scarcely more than a month the hopes of Dr. Clarendon’s admirers wereamply fulfilled. Sweeping changes in methods brought to the prison’s medical routine anefficiency never before dreamed of; and though the subordinates were naturally not without jealousy,they were obliged to admit the magical results of a really great man’s superintendence.Then came a time where mere appreciation might well have grown to devout thankfulness at a providentialconjunction of time, place, and man; for one morning Dr. Jones came to his new chief with agrave face to announce his discovery of a case which he could not but identify as that selfsameblack fever whose germ Clarendon had found and classified.
Dr. Clarendon shewed no surprise, but kept on at the writing before him.
“I know,” he said evenly; “I came across that case yesterday.I’m glad you recognised it. Put the man in a separate ward, though I don’t believethis fever is contagious.”
Dr. Jones, with his own opinion of the malady’s contagiousness, was gladof this deference to caution; and hastened to execute the order. Upon his return Clarendon roseto leave, declaring that he would himself take charge of the case alone. Disappointed in hiswish to study the great man’s methods and technique, the junior physician watched his chiefstride away toward the lone ward where he had placed the patient, more critical of the new regimethan at any time since admiration had displaced his first jealous pangs.
Reaching the ward, Clarendon entered hastily, glancing at the bed and steppingback to see how far Dr. Jones’s obvious curiosity might have led him. Then, finding thecorridor still vacant, he shut the door and turned to examine the sufferer. The man was a convictof a peculiarly repulsive type, and seemed to be racked by the keenest throes of agony. Hisfeatures were frightfully contracted, and his knees drawn sharply up in the mute desperationof the stricken. Clarendon studied him closely, raising his tightly shut eyelids, took his pulseand temperature, and finally dissolving a tablet in water, forced the solution between the sufferer’slips. Before long the height of the attack abated, as shewn by the relaxing body and returningnormality of expression, and the patient began to breathe more easily. Then, by a soft rubbingof the ears, the doctor caused the man to open his eyes. There was life in them, for they movedfrom side to side, though they lacked the fine fire which we are wont to deem the image of thesoul. Clarendon smiled as he surveyed the peace his help had brought, feeling behind him thepower of an all-capable science. He had long known of this case, and had snatched the victimfrom death with the work of a moment. Another hour and this man would have gone—yet Joneshad seen the symptoms for days before discovering them, and having discovered them, did notknow what to do.
Man’s conquest of disease, however, cannot be perfect. Clarendon, assuringthe dubious trusty-nurses that the fever was not contagious, had had the patient bathed, spongedin alcohol, and put to bed; but was told the next morning that the case was lost. The man haddied after midnight in the most intense agony, and with such cries and distortions of face thatthe nurses were driven almost to panic. The doctor took this news with his usual calm, whateverhis scientific feelings may have been, and ordered the burial of the patient in quicklime. Then,with a philosophic shrug of the shoulders, he made the usual rounds of the penitentiary.
Two days later the prison was hit again. Three men came down at once this time,and there was no concealing the fact that a black fever epidemic was under way. Clarendon, havingadhered so firmly to his theory of non-contagiousness, suffered a distinct loss of prestige,and was handicapped by the refusal of the trusty-nurses to attend the patients. Theirs was notthe soul-free devotion of those who sacrifice themselves to science and humanity. They wereconvicts, serving only because of the privileges they could not otherwise buy, and when theprice became too great they preferred to resign the privileges.
But the doctor was still master of the situation. Consulting with the wardenand sending urgent messages to his friend the governor, he saw to it that special rewards incash and in reduced terms were offered to the convicts for the dangerous nursing service; andby this method succeeded in getting a very fair quota of volunteers. He was steeled for actionnow, and nothing could shake his poise and determination. Additional cases brought only a curtnod, and he seemed a stranger to fatigue as he hastened from bedside to bedside all over thevast stone home of sadness and evil. More than forty cases developed within another week, andnurses had to be brought from the city. Clarendon went home very seldom at this stage, oftensleeping on a cot in the warden’s quarters, and always giving himself up with typical abandonto the service of medicine and of mankind.
Then came the first mutterings of that storm which was soon to convulse SanFrancisco. News will out, and the menace of black fever spread over the town like a fog fromthe bay. Reporters trained in the doctrine of “sensation first” used their imaginationwithout restraint, and gloried when at last they were able to produce a case in the Mexicanquarter which a local physician—fonder perhaps of money than of truth or civic welfare—pronouncedblack fever.
That was the last straw. Frantic at the thought of the crawling death so closeupon them, the people of San Francisco went mad en masse, and embarked upon that historic exodusof which all the country was soon to hear over busy wires. Ferries and rowboats, excursion steamersand launches, railways and cable cars, bicycles and carriages, moving-vans and work carts, allwere pressed into instant and frenzied service. Sausalito and Tamalpais, as lying in the directionof San Quentin, shared in the flight; while housing space in Oakland, Berkeley, and Alamedarose to fabulous prices. Tent colonies sprang up, and improvised villages lined the crowdedsouthward highways from Millbrae to San Jose. Many sought refuge with friends in Sacramento,while the fright-shaken residue forced by various causes to stay behind could do little morethan maintain the basic necessities of a nearly dead city.
Business, save for quack doctors with “sure cures” and “preventives”for use against the fever, fell rapidly to the vanishing-point. At first the saloons offered“medicated drinks”, but soon found that the populace preferred to be duped by charlatansof more professional aspect. In strangely noiseless streets persons peered into one another’sfaces to glimpse possible plague symptoms, and shopkeepers began more and more to refuse admissionto their clientele, each customer seeming to them a fresh fever menace. Legal and judicial machinerybegan to disintegrate as attorneys and county clerks succumbed one by one to the urge for flight.Even the doctors deserted in large numbers, many of them pleading the need of vacations amongthe mountains and the lakes in the northern part of the state. Schools and colleges, theatresand cafés, restaurants and saloons, all gradually closed their doors; and in a singleweek San Francisco lay prostrate and inert with only its light, power, and water service evenhalf normal, with newspapers in skeletonic form, and with a crippled parody on transportationmaintained by the horse and cable cars.
This was the lowest ebb. It could not last long, for courage and observationare not altogether dead in mankind; and sooner or later the non-existence of any widespreadblack fever epidemic outside San Quentin became too obvious a fact to deny, notwithstandingseveral actual cases and the undeniable spread of typhoid in the unsanitary suburban tent colonies.The leaders and editors of the community conferred and took action, enlisting in their servicethe very reporters whose energies had done so much to bring on the trouble, but now turningtheir “sensation first” avidity into more constructive channels. Editorials and fictitiousinterviews appeared, telling of Dr. Clarendon’s complete control of the disease, and ofthe absolute impossibility of its diffusion beyond the prison walls. Reiteration and circulationslowly did their work, and gradually a slim backward trickle of urbanites swelled into a vigorousrefluent stream. One of the first healthy symptoms was the start of a newspaper controversyof the approved acrimonious kind, attempting to fix blame for the panic wherever the variousparticipants thought it belonged. The returning doctors, jealously strengthened by their timelyvacations, began striking at Clarendon, assuring the public that they as well as he would keepthe fever in leash, and censuring him for not doing even more to check its spread within SanQuentin.
Clarendon had, they averred, permitted far more deaths than were necessary.The veriest tyro in medicine knew how to check fever contagion; and if this renowned savantdid not do it, it was clearly because he chose for scientific reasons to study the final effectsof the disease, rather than to prescribe properly and save the victims. This policy, they insinuated,might be proper enough among convicted murderers in a penal institution, but it would not doin San Francisco, where life was still a precious and sacred thing. Thus they went on, and thepapers were glad to publish all they wrote, since the sharpness of the campaign, in which Dr.Clarendon would doubtless join, would help to obliterate confusion and restore confidence amongthe people.
But Clarendon did not reply. He only smiled, while his singular clinic-manSurama indulged in many a deep, testudinous chuckle. He was at home more nowadays, so that reportersbegan besieging the gate of the great wall the doctor had built around his house, instead ofpestering the warden’s office at San Quentin. Results, though, were equally meagre; forSurama formed an impassable barrier between the doctor and the outer world—even after thereporters had got into the grounds. The newspaper men getting access to the front hall had glimpsesof Clarendon’s singular entourage and made the best they could in a “write-up”of Surama and the queer skeletonic Thibetans. Exaggeration, of course, occurred in every fresharticle, and the net effect of the publicity was distinctly adverse to the great physician.Most persons hate the unusual, and hundreds who could have excused heartlessness or incompetencestood ready to condemn the grotesque taste manifested in the chuckling attendant and the eightblack-robed Orientals.
Early in January an especially persistent young man from the Observerclimbed the moated eight-foot brick wall in the rear of the Clarendon grounds and began a surveyof the varied outdoor appearances which trees concealed from the front walk. With quick, alertbrain he took in everything—the rose-arbour, the aviaries, the animal cages where all sortsof mammalia from monkeys to guinea-pigs might be seen and heard, the stout wooden clinic buildingwith barred windows in the northwest corner of the yard—and bent searching glances throughoutthe thousand square feet of intramural privacy. A great article was brewing, and he would haveescaped unscathed but for the barking of Dick, Georgina Clarendon’s gigantic and belovedSt. Bernard. Surama, instant in his response, had the youth by the collar before a protest couldbe uttered, and was presently shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat, and dragging him throughthe trees to the front yard and the gate.
Breathless explanations and quavering demands to see Dr. Clarendon were useless.Surama only chuckled and dragged his victim on. Suddenly a positive fright crept over the dapperscribe, and he began to wish desperately that this unearthly creature would speak if only toprove that he really was a being of honest flesh and blood belonging to this planet. He becamedeathly sick, and strove not to glimpse the eyes which he knew must lie at the base of thosegaping black sockets. Soon he heard the gate open and felt himself propelled violently through;in another moment waking rudely to the things of earth as he landed wetly and muddily in theditch which Clarendon had had dug around the entire length of the wall. Fright gave a placeto rage as he heard the massive gate slam shut, and he rose dripping to shake his fist at theforbidding portal. Then, as he turned to go, a soft sound grated behind him, and through a smallwicket in the gate he felt the sunken eyes of Surama and heard the echoes of a deep-voiced,blood-freezing chuckle.
This young man, feeling perhaps justly that his handling had been rougher thanhe deserved, resolved to revenge himself upon the household responsible for his treatment. Accordinglyhe prepared a fictitious interview with Dr. Clarendon, supposed to be held in the clinic building,during which he was careful to describe the agonies of a dozen black fever patients whom hisimagination ranged on orderly rows of couches. His master-stroke was the picture of one especiallypathetic sufferer gasping for water, while the doctor held a glass of the sparkling fluid justout of his reach, in a scientific attempt to determine the effect of a tantalising emotion onthe course of the disease. This invention was followed by paragraphs of insinuating commentso outwardly respectful that it bore a double venom. Dr. Clarendon was, the article ran, undoubtedlythe greatest and most single-minded scientist in the world; but science is no friend to individualwelfare, and one would not like to have one’s gravest ills drawn out and aggravated merelyto satisfy an investigator on some point of abstract truth. Life is too short for that.
Altogether, the article was diabolically skilful, and succeeded in horrifyingnine readers out of ten against Dr. Clarendon and his supposed methods. Other papers were quickto copy and enlarge upon its substance, taking the cue it offered, and commencing a series of“faked” interviews which fairly ran the gamut of derogatory fantasy. In no case, however,did the doctor condescend to offer a contradiction. He had no time to waste on fools and liars,and cared little for the esteem of a thoughtless rabble he despised. When James Dalton telegraphedhis regrets and offered aid, Clarendon replied with an almost boorish curtness. He did not heedthe barking of dogs, and could not bother to muzzle them. Nor would he thank anyone for messingwith a matter wholly beneath notice. Silent and contemptuous, he continued his duties with tranquilevenness.
But the young reporter’s spark had done its work. San Francisco was insaneagain, and this time as much with rage as with fear. Sober judgment became a lost art; and thoughno second exodus occurred, there ensued a reign of vice and recklessness born of desperation,and suggesting parallel phenomena in mediaeval times of pestilence. Hatred ran riot againstthe man who had found the disease and was struggling to restrain it, and a light-headed publicforgot his great services to knowledge in their efforts to fan the flames of resentment. Theyseemed, in their blindness, to hate him in person, rather than the plague which had come totheir breeze-cleaned and usually healthy city.
Then the young reporter, playing in the Neronic fire he had kindled, addeda crowning personal touch of his own. Remembering the indignities he had suffered at the handsof the cadaverous clinic-man, he prepared a masterly article on the home and environment ofDr. Clarendon, giving especial prominence to Surama, whose very aspect he declared sufficientto scare the healthiest person into any sort of fever. He tried to make the gaunt chuckler appearequally ridiculous and terrible, succeeding best, perhaps, in the latter half of his intention,since a tide of horror always welled up whenever he thought of his brief proximity to the creature.He collected all the rumours current about the man, elaborated on the unholy depth of his reputedscholarship, and hinted darkly that it could have been no godly realm of secret and aeon-weightedAfrica wherein Dr. Clarendon had found him.
Georgina, who followed the papers closely, felt crushed and hurt by these attacksupon her brother, but James Dalton, who called often at the house, did his best to comfort her.In this he was warm and sincere; for he wished not only to console the woman he loved, but toutter some measure of the reverence he had always felt for the starward-bound genius who hadbeen his youth’s closest comrade. He told Georgina how greatness can never be exemptedfrom the shafts of envy, and cited the long, sad list of splendid brains crushed beneath vulgarheels. The attacks, he pointed out, formed the truest of all proofs of Alfred’s solid eminence.
“But they hurt just the same,” she rejoined, “and all the morebecause I know that Al really suffers from them, no matter how indifferent he tries to be.”
Dalton kissed her hand in a manner not then obsolete among well-born persons.
“And it hurts me a thousand times more, knowing that it hurts you andAlf. But never mind, Georgie, we’ll stand together and pull through it!”
Thus it came about that Georgina came more and more to rely on the strengthof the steel-firm, square-jawed governor who had been her youthful swain, and more and moreto confide in him the things she feared. The press attacks and the epidemic were not quite all.There were aspects of the household which she did not like. Surama, cruel in equal measure toman and beast, filled her with the most unnamable repulsion; and she could not but feel thathe meant some vague, indefinable harm to Alfred. She did not like the Thibetans, either, andthought it very peculiar that Surama was able to talk with them. Alfred would not tell her whoor what Surama was, but had once explained rather haltingly that he was a much older man thanwould be commonly thought credible, and that he had mastered secrets and been through experiencescalculated to make him a colleague of phenomenal value for any scientist seeking Nature’shidden mysteries.
Urged by her uneasiness, Dalton became a still more frequent visitor at theClarendon home, though he saw that his presence was deeply resented by Surama. The bony clinic-manformed the habit of glaring peculiarly from those spectral sockets when admitting him, and wouldoften, after closing the gate when he left, chuckle monotonously in a manner that made his fleshcreep. Meanwhile Dr. Clarendon seemed oblivious of everything save his work at San Quentin,whither he went each day in his launch—alone save for Surama, who managed the wheel whilethe doctor read or collated his notes. Dalton welcomed these regular absences, for they gavehim constant opportunities to renew his suit for Georgina’s hand. When he would overstayand meet Alfred, however, the latter’s greeting was always friendly despite his habitualreserve. In time the engagement of James and Georgina grew to be a definite thing, and the twoawaited only a favourable chance to speak to Alfred.
The governor, whole-souled in everything and firm in his protective loyalty,spared no pains in spreading propaganda on his old friend’s behalf. Press and officialdomboth felt his influence, and he even succeeded in interesting scientists in the East, many ofwhom came to California to study the plague and investigate the anti-fever bacillus which Clarendonwas so rapidly isolating and perfecting. These doctors and biologists, however, did not obtainthe information they wished; so that several of them left with a very unfortunate impression.Not a few prepared articles hostile to Clarendon, accusing him of an unscientific and fame-seekingattitude, and intimating that he concealed his methods through a highly unprofessional desirefor ultimate personal profit.
Others, fortunately, were more liberal in their judgments, and wrote enthusiasticallyof Clarendon and his work. They had seen the patients, and could appreciate how marvellouslyhe held the dread disease in leash. His secrecy regarding the antitoxin they deemed quite justifiable,since its public diffusion in unperfected form could not but do more harm than good. Clarendonhimself, whom many of their number had met before, impressed them more profoundly than ever,and they did not hesitate to compare him with Jenner, Lister, Koch, Pasteur, Metchnikoff, andthe rest of those whose whole lives have served pathology and humanity. Dalton was careful tosave for Alfred all the magazines that spoke well of him, bringing them in person as an excuseto see Georgina. They did not, however, produce much effect save a contemptuous smile; and Clarendonwould generally throw them to Surama, whose deep, disturbing chuckle upon reading formed a closeparallel to the doctor’s own ironic amusement.
One Monday evening early in February Dalton called with the definite intentionof asking Clarendon for his sister’s hand. Georgina herself admitted him to the grounds,and as they walked toward the house he stopped to pat the great dog which rushed up and laidfriendly fore paws on his breast. It was Dick, Georgina’s cherished St. Bernard, and Daltonwas glad to feel that he had the affection of a creature which meant so much to her.
Dick was excited and glad, and turned the governor nearly half about with hisvigorous pressure as he gave a soft quick bark and sprang off through the trees toward the clinic.He did not vanish, though, but presently stopped and looked back, softly barking again as ifhe wished Dalton to follow. Georgina, fond of obeying her huge pet’s playful whims, motionedto James to see what he wanted; and they both walked slowly after him as he trotted relievedlyto the rear of the yard where the top of the clinic building stood silhouetted against the starsabove the great brick wall.
The outline of lights within shewed around the edges of the dark window-curtainsso they knew that Alfred and Surama were at work. Suddenly from the interior came a thin, subduedsound like a cry of a child—a plaintive call of “Mamma! Mamma!” at which Dickbarked, while James and Georgina started perceptibly. Then Georgina smiled, remembering theparrots that Clarendon always kept for experimental uses, and patted Dick on the head eitherto forgive him for having fooled her and Dalton, or to console him for having been fooled himself.
As they turned slowly toward the house Dalton mentioned his resolve to speakto Alfred that evening about their engagement, and Georgina supplied no objection. She knewthat her brother would not relish the loss of a faithful manager and companion, but believedhis affection would place no barrier in the way of her happiness.
Later that evening Clarendon came into the house with a springy step and aspectless grim than usual. Dalton, seeing a good omen in this easy buoyancy, took heart as the doctorwrung his hand with a jovial “Ah, Jimmy, how’s politics this year?” He glancedat Georgina, and she quietly excused herself, while the two men settled down to a chat on generalsubjects. Little by little, amidst many reminders of their old youthful days, Dalton workedtoward his point; till at last he came out plainly with the crucial query.
“Alf, I want to marry Georgina. Have we your blessing?”
Keenly watching his old friend, Dalton saw a shadow steal over his face. Thedark eyes flashed for a moment, then veiled themselves as wonted placidity returned. So scienceor selfishness was at work after all!
“You’re asking an impossibility, James. Georgina isn’t the aimlessbutterfly she was years ago. She has a place in the service of truth and mankind now, and thatplace is here. She’s decided to devote her life to my work—to the household that makesmy work possible—and there’s no room for desertion or personal caprice.”
Dalton waited to see if he had finished. The same old fanaticism—humanityversus the individual—and the doctor was going to let it spoil his sister’s life!Then he tried to answer.
“But look here, Alf, do you mean to say that Georgina, in particular,is so necessary to your work that you must make a slave and martyr of her? Use your sense ofproportion, man! If it were a question of Surama or somebody in the utter thick of your experimentsit might be different; but after all, Georgina is only a housekeeper to you in the last analysis.She has promised to be my wife and says that she loves me. Have you the right to cut her offfrom the life that belongs to her? Have you the right—“
“That’ll do, James!” Clarendon’s face was set and white.“Whether or not I have the right to govern my own family is no business of an outsider.”
“Outsider—you can say that to a man who—“ Dalton almostchoked as the steely voice of the doctor interrupted him again.
“An outsider to my family, and from now on an outsider to my home. Dalton,your presumption goes just a little too far! Good evening, Governor!”
And Clarendon strode from the room without extending his hand.
Dalton hesitated for a moment, almost at a loss what to do, when presentlyGeorgina entered. Her face shewed that she had spoken with her brother, and Dalton took bothher hands impetuously.
“Well, Georgie, what do you say? I’m afraid it’s a choice betweenAlf and me. You know how I feel—you know how I felt before, when it was your father I wasup against. What’s your answer this time?”
He paused as she responded slowly.
“James, dear, do you believe that I love you?”
He nodded and pressed her hands expectantly.
“Then, if you love me, you’ll wait a while. Don’t think of Al’srudeness. He’s to be pitied. I can’t tell you the whole thing now, but you know howworried I am—what with the strain of his work, the criticisms, and the staring and cacklingof that horrible creature Surama! I’m afraid he’ll break down—he shews the strainmore than anyone outside the family could tell. I can see it, for I’ve watched him allmy life. He’s changing—slowly bending under his burdens—and he puts on his extrabrusqueness to hide it. You can see what I mean, can’t you, dear?”
She paused, and Dalton nodded again, pressing one of her hands to his breast.Then she concluded.
“So promise me, dear, to be patient. I must stand by him; I must! I must!”
Dalton did not speak for a while, but his head inclined in what was almosta bow of reverence. There was more of Christ in this devoted woman than he had thought any humanbeing possessed; and in the face of such love and loyalty he could do no urging.
Words of sadness and parting were brief; and James, whose blue eyes were misty,scarcely saw the gaunt clinic-man as the gate to the street was at last opened to him. But whenit slammed to behind him he heard that blood-curdling chuckle he had come to recognise so well,and knew that Surama was there—Surama, whom Georgina had called her brother’s evilgenius. Walking away with a firm step, Dalton resolved to be watchful, and to act at the firstsign of trouble.

III.

Meanwhile San Francisco, the epidemic still on the lips of all, seethed withanti-Clarendon feeling. Actually the cases outside the penitentiary were very few, and confinedalmost wholly to the lower Mexican element whose lack of sanitation was a standing invitationto disease of every kind; but politicians and the people needed no more than this to confirmthe attacks made by the doctor’s enemies. Seeing that Dalton was immovable in his championshipof Clarendon, the malcontents, medical dogmatists, and ward-heelers turned their attention tothe state legislature; lining up the anti-Clarendonists and the governor’s old enemieswith great shrewdness, and preparing to launch a law—with a veto-proof majority—transferringthe authority for minor institutional appointments from the chief executive to the various boardsor commissions concerned.
In the furtherance of this measure no lobbyist was more active than Clarendon’schief assistant, Dr. Jones. Jealous of his superior from the first, he now saw an opportunityfor turning matters to his liking; and he thanked fate for the circumstance—responsibleindeed for his present position—of his relationship to the chairman of the prison board.The new law, if passed, would certainly mean the removal of Clarendon and the appointment ofhimself in his stead; so, mindful of his own interest, he worked hard for it. Jones was allthat Clarendon was not—a natural politician and sycophantic opportunist who served hisown advancement first and science only incidentally. He was poor, and avid for salaried position,quite in contrast to the wealthy and independent savant he sought to displace. So with a rat-likecunning and persistence he laboured to undermine the great biologist above him, and was oneday rewarded by the news that the new law was passed. Thenceforward the governor was powerlessto make appointments to the state institutions, and the medical directorship of San Quentinlay at the disposal of the prison board.
Of all this legislative turmoil Clarendon was singularly oblivious. Wrappedwholly in matters of administration and research, he was blind to the treason of “thatass Jones” who worked by his side, and deaf to all the gossip of the warden’s office.He had never in his life read the newspapers, and the banishment of Dalton from his house cutoff his last real link with the world of outside events. With the naiveté of a recluse,he at no time thought of his position as insecure. In view of Dalton’s loyalty, and ofhis forgiveness of even the greatest wrongs, as shewn in his dealings with the elder Clarendonwho had crushed his father to death on the stock exchange, the possibility of a gubernatorialdismissal was, of course, out of the question; nor could the doctor’s political ignoranceenvisage a sudden shift of power which might place the matter of retention or dismissal in verydifferent hands. Thereupon he merely smiled with satisfaction when Dalton left for Sacramento;convinced that his place in San Quentin and his sister’s place in his household were alikesecure from disturbance. He was accustomed to having what he wanted, and fancied his luck wasstill holding out.
The first week in March, a day or so after the enactment of the new law, thechairman of the prison board called at San Quentin. Clarendon was out, but Dr. Jones was gladto shew the august visitor—his own uncle, incidentally—through the great infirmary,including the fever ward made so famous by press and panic. By this time converted against hiswill to Clarendon’s belief in the fever’s non-contagiousness, Jones smilingly assuredhis uncle that nothing was to be feared, and encouraged him to inspect the patients in detail—especiallya ghastly skeleton, once a very giant of bulk and vigour, who was, he insinuated, slowly andpainfully dying because Clarendon would not administer the proper medicine.
“Do you mean to say,” cried the chairman, “that Dr. Clarendonrefuses to let the man have what he needs, knowing his life could be saved?”
“Just that,” snapped Dr. Jones, pausing as the door opened to admitnone other than Clarendon himself. Clarendon nodded coldly to Jones and surveyed the visitor,whom he did not know, with disapproval.
“Dr. Jones, I thought you knew this case was not to be disturbed at all.And haven’t I said that visitors aren’t to be admitted except by special permission?”
But the chairman interrupted before his nephew could introduce him.
“Pardon me, Dr. Clarendon, but am I to understand that you refuse to givethis man the medicine that would save him?”
Clarendon glared coldly, and rejoined with steel in his voice.
“That’s an impertinent question, sir. I am in authority here, andvisitors are not allowed. Please leave the room at once.”
The chairman, his sense of drama secretly tickled, answered with greater pompand hauteur than were necessary.
“You mistake me, sir! I, not you, am master here. You are addressing thechairman of the prison board. I must say, moreover, that I deem your activity a menace to thewelfare of the prisoners, and must request your resignation. Henceforth Dr. Jones will be incharge, and if you wish to remain until your formal dismissal you will take your orders fromhim.”
It was Wilfred Jones’s great moment. Life never gave him another suchclimax, and we need not grudge him this one. After all, he was a small rather than a bad man,and he had only obeyed a small man’s code of looking to himself at all costs. Clarendonstood still, gazing at the speaker as if he thought him mad, till in another second the lookof triumph on Dr. Jones’s face convinced him that something important was indeed afoot.He was icily courteous as he replied.
“No doubt you are what you claim to be, sir. But fortunately my appointmentcame from the governor of the state, and can therefore be revoked only by him.”
The chairman and his nephew both stared perplexedly, for they had not realisedto what lengths unworldly ignorance can go. Then the older man, grasping the situation, explainedat some length.
“Had I found that the current reports did you an injustice,” he concluded,“I would have deferred action; but the case of this poor man and your own arrogant mannerleft me no choice. As it is—“
But Dr. Clarendon interrupted with a new razor-sharpness in his voice.
“As it is, I am the director in charge at present, and I ask you to leavethis room at once.”
The chairman reddened and exploded.
“Look here, sir, who do you think you’re talking to? I’ll haveyou chucked out of here—damn your impertinence!”
But he had time only to finish the sentence. Transformed by the insult to asudden dynamo of hate, the slender scientist launched out with both fists in a burst of preternaturalstrength of which no one would have thought him capable. And if his strength was preternatural,his accuracy of aim was no less so; for not even a champion of the ring could have wrought aneater result. Both men—the chairman and Dr. Jones—were squarely hit; the one fullin the face and the other on the point of the chin. Going down like felled trees, they lay motionlessand unconscious on the floor; while Clarendon, now clear and completely master of himself, tookhis hat and cane and went out to join Surama in the launch. Only when seated in the moving boatdid he at last give audible vent to the frightful rage that consumed him. Then, with face convulsed,he called down imprecations from the stars and the gulfs beyond the stars; so that even Suramashuddered, made an elder sign that no book of history records, and forgot to chuckle.

IV.

Georgina soothed her brother’s hurt as best she could. He had come homementally and physically exhausted and thrown himself on the library lounge; and in that gloomyroom, little by little, the faithful sister had taken in the almost incredible news. Her consolationswere instantaneous and tender, and she made him realise how vast, though unconscious, a tributeto his greatness the attacks, persecution, and dismissal all were. He had tried to cultivatethe indifference she preached, and could have done so had personal dignity alone been involved.But the loss of scientific opportunity was more than he could calmly bear, and he sighed againand again as he repeated how three months more of study in the prison might have given him atlast the long-sought bacillus which would make all fever a thing of the past.
Then Georgina tried another mode of cheering, and told him that surely theprison board would send for him again if the fever did not abate, or if it broke out with increasedforce. But even this was ineffective, and Clarendon answered only in a string of bitter, ironic,and half-meaningless little sentences whose tone shewed all too clearly how deeply despair andresentment had bitten.
“Abate? Break out again? Oh, it’ll abate all right! At least, they’llthink it has abated. They’d think anything, no matter what happens! Ignorant eyes see nothing,and bunglers are never discoverers. Science never shews her face to that sort. And they callthemselves doctors! Best of all, fancy that ass Jones in charge!”
Ceasing with a quick sneer, he laughed so daemoniacally that Georgina shivered.
The days that followed were dismal ones indeed at the Clarendon mansion. Depression,stark and unrelieved, had taken hold of the doctor’s usually tireless mind; and he wouldeven have refused food had not Georgina forced it upon him. His great notebook of observationslay unopened on the library table, and his little gold syringe of anti-fever serum—a cleverdevice of his own, with a self-contained reservoir, attached to a broad gold finger ring, andsingle-pressure action peculiar to itself—rested idly in a small leather case beside it.Vigour, ambition, and the desire for study and observation seemed to have died within him; andhe made no inquiries about his clinic, where hundreds of germ cultures stood in their orderlyphials awaiting his attention.
The countless animals held for experiments played, lively and well fed, inthe early spring sunshine; and as Georgina strolled out through the rose-arbour to the cagesshe felt a strangely incongruous sense of happiness about her. She knew, though, how tragicallytransient that happiness must be; since the start of new work would soon make all these smallcreatures unwilling martyrs to science. Knowing this, she glimpsed a sort of compensating elementin her brother’s inaction, and encouraged him to keep on in a rest he needed so badly.The eight Thibetan servants moved noiselessly about, each as impeccably effective as usual;and Georgina saw to it that the order of the household did not suffer because of the master’srelaxation.
Study and starward ambition laid aside in slippered and dressing-gowned indifference,Clarendon was content to let Georgina treat him as an infant. He met her maternal fussinesswith a slow, sad smile, and always obeyed her multitude of orders and precepts. A kind of faint,wistful felicity came over the languid household, amidst which the only dissenting note wassupplied by Surama. He indeed was miserable, and looked often with sullen and resentful eyesat the sunny serenity in Georgina’s face. His only joy had been the turmoil of experiment,and he missed the routine of seizing the fated animals, bearing them to the clinic in clutchingtalons, and watching them with hot brooding gaze and evil chuckles as they gradually fell intothe final coma with wide-opened, red-rimmed eyes, and swollen tongue lolling from froth-coveredmouth.
Now he was seemingly driven to desperation by the sight of the carefree creaturesin their cages, and frequently came to ask Clarendon if there were any orders. Finding the doctorapathetic and unwilling to begin work, he would go away muttering under his breath and glaringcurses upon everything; stealing with cat-like tread to his own quarters in the basement, wherehis voice would sometimes ascend in deep, muffled rhythms of blasphemous strangeness and uncomfortablyritualistic suggestion.
All this wore on Georgina’s nerves, but not by any means so gravely asher brother’s continued lassitude itself. The duration of the state alarmed her, and littleby little she lost the air of cheerfulness which had so provoked the clinic-man. Herself skilledin medicine, she found the doctor’s condition highly unsatisfactory from an alienist’spoint of view; and she now feared as much from his absence of interest and activity as she hadformerly feared from his fanatical zeal and overstudy. Was lingering melancholy about to turnthe once brilliant man of intellect into an innocuous imbecile?
Then, toward the end of May, came the sudden change. Georgina always recalledthe smallest details connected with it; details as trivial as the box delivered to Surama theday before, postmarked Algiers, and emitting a most unpleasant odour; and the sharp, suddenthunderstorm, rare in the extreme for California, which sprang up that night as Surama chantedhis rituals behind his locked basement door in a droning chest-voice louder and more intensethan usual.
It was a sunny day, and she had been in the garden gathering flowers for thedining-room. Re-entering the house, she glimpsed her brother in the library, fully dressed andseated at the table, alternately consulting the notes in his thick observation book, and makingfresh entries with brisk assured strokes of the pen. He was alert and vital, and there was asatisfying resilience about his movements as he now and then turned a page, or reached for abook from the rear of the great table. Delighted and relieved, Georgina hastened to deposither flowers in the dining-room and return; but when she reached the library again she foundthat her brother was gone.
She knew, of course, that he must be in the clinic at work, and rejoiced tothink that his old mind and purpose had snapped back into place. Realising it would be of nouse to delay the luncheon for him, she ate alone and set aside a bite to be kept warm in caseof his return at an odd moment. But he did not come. He was making up for lost time, and wasstill in the great stout-planked clinic when she went for a stroll through the rose-arbour.
As she walked among the fragrant blossoms she saw Surama fetching animals forthe test. She wished she could notice him less, for he always made her shudder; but her verydread had sharpened her eyes and ears where he was concerned. He always went hatless aroundthe yard, and the total hairlessness of his head enhanced his skeleton-like aspect horribly.Now she heard a faint chuckle as he took a small monkey from its cage against the wall and carriedit to the clinic, his long, bony fingers pressing so cruelly into its furry sides that it criedout in frightened anguish. The sight sickened her, and brought her walk to an end. Her inmostsoul rebelled at the ascendancy this creature had gained over her brother, and she reflectedbitterly that the two had almost changed places as master and servant.
Night came without Clarendon’s return to the house, and Georgina concludedthat he was absorbed in one of his very longest sessions, which meant total disregard of time.She hated to retire without a talk with him about his sudden recovery; but finally, feelingit would be futile to wait up, she wrote a cheerful note and propped it before his chair onthe library table; then started resolutely for bed.
She was not quite asleep when she heard the outer door open and shut. So ithad not been an all-night session after all! Determined to see that her brother had a meal beforeretiring she rose, slipped on a robe, and descended to the library, halting only when she heardvoices from behind the half-opened door. Clarendon and Surama were talking, and she waited tillthe clinic-man might go.
Surama, however, shewed no inclination to depart; and indeed, the whole heatedtenor of the discourse seemed to bespeak absorption and promise length. Georgina, though shehad not meant to listen, could not help catching a phrase now and then, and presently becameaware of a sinister undercurrent which frightened her very much without being wholly clear toher. Her brother’s voice, nervous, incisive, held her notice with disquieting persistence.
“But anyway,” he was saying, “we haven’t enough animalsfor another day, and you know how hard it is to get a decent supply at short notice. It seemssilly to waste so much effort on comparative trash when human specimens could be had with justa little extra care.”
Georgina sickened at the possible implication, and caught at the hall rackto steady herself. Surama was replying in that deep, hollow tone which seemed to echo with theevil of a thousand ages and a thousand planets.
“Steady, steady—what a child you are with your haste and impatience!You crowd things so! When you’ve lived as I have, so that a whole life will seem only anhour, you won’t be so fretful about a day or week or month! You work too fast. You’veplenty of specimens in the cages for a full week if you’ll only go at a sensible rate.You might even begin on the older material if you’d be sure not to overdo it.”
“Never mind my haste!” the reply was snapped out sharply; “Ihave my own methods. I don’t want to use our material if I can help it, for I prefer themas they are. And you’d better be careful of them anyway—you know the knives thosesly dogs carry.”
Surama’s deep chuckle came.
“Don’t worry about that. The brutes eat, don’t they? Well, Ican get you one any time you need it. But go slow—with the boy gone, there are only eight,and now that you’ve lost San Quentin it’ll be hard to get new ones by the wholesale.I’d advise you to start in on Tsanpo—he’s the least use to you as he is, and—“
But that was all Georgina heard. Transfixed by a hideous dread from the thoughtsthis talk excited, she nearly sank to the floor where she stood, and was scarcely able to dragherself up the stairs and into her room. What was the evil monster Surama planning? Into whatwas he guiding her brother? What monstrous circumstances lay behind these cryptic sentences?A thousand phantoms of darkness and menace danced before her eyes, and she flung herself uponthe bed without hope of sleep. One thought above the rest stood out with fiendish prominence,and she almost screamed aloud as it beat itself into her brain with renewed force. Then Nature,kinder than she expected, intervened at last. Closing her eyes in a dead faint, she did notawake till morning, nor did any fresh nightmare come to join the lasting one which the overheardwords had brought.
With the morning sunshine came a lessening of the tension. What happens inthe night when one is tired often reaches the consciousness in distorted forms, and Georginacould see that her brain must have given strange colour to scraps of common medical conversation.To suppose her brother—only son of the gentle Frances Schuyler Clarendon—guilty ofsavage sacrifices in the name of science would be to do an injustice to their blood, and shedecided to omit all mention of her trip downstairs, lest Alfred ridicule her fantastic notions.
When she reached the breakfast table she found that Clarendon was already gone,and regretted that not even this second morning had given her a chance to congratulate him onhis revived activity. Quietly taking the breakfast served by stone-deaf old Margarita, the Mexicancook, she read the morning paper and seated herself with some needlework by the sitting-roomwindow overlooking the great yard. All was silent out there, and she could see that the lastof the animal cages had been emptied. Science was served, and the lime-pit held all that wasleft of the once pretty and lively little creatures. This slaughter had always grieved her,but she had never complained, since she knew it was all for humanity. Being a scientist’ssister, she used to say to herself, was like being the sister of a soldier who kills to savehis countrymen from their foes.
After luncheon Georgina resumed her post by the window, and had been busilysewing for some time when the sound of a pistol shot from the yard caused her to look out inalarm. There, not far from the clinic, she saw the ghastly form of Surama, a revolver in hishand, and his skull-face twisted into a strange expression as he chuckled at a cowering figurerobed in black silk and carrying a long Thibetan knife. It was the servant Tsanpo, and as sherecognised the shrivelled face Georgina remembered horribly what she had overheard the nightbefore. The sun flashed on the polished blade, and suddenly Surama’s revolver spat oncemore. This time the knife flew from the Mongol’s hand, and Surama glanced greedily at hisshaking and bewildered prey.
Then Tsanpo, glancing quickly at his unhurt hand and at the fallen knife, sprangnimbly away from the stealthily approaching clinic-man and made a dash for the house. Surama,however, was too swift for him, and caught him in a single leap, seizing his shoulder and almostcrushing him. For a moment the Thibetan tried to struggle, but Surama lifted him like an animalby the scruff of the neck and bore him off toward the clinic. Georgina heard him chuckling andtaunting the man in his own tongue, and saw the yellow face of the victim twist and quiver withfright. Suddenly realising against her own will what was taking place, a great horror masteredher and she fainted for the second time within twenty-four hours.
When consciousness returned, the golden light of late afternoon was floodingthe room. Georgina, picking up her fallen work-basket and scattered materials, was lost in adaze of doubt; but finally felt convinced that the scene which had overcome her must have beenall too tragically real. Her worst fears, then, were horrible truths. What to do about it, nothingin her experience could tell her; and she was vaguely thankful that her brother did not appear.She must talk to him, but not now. She could not talk to anybody now. And, thinking shudderinglyof the monstrous happening behind those barred clinic windows, she crept into bed for a longnight of anguished sleeplessness.
Rising haggardly on the following day, Georgina saw the doctor for the firsttime since his recovery. He was bustling about preoccupiedly, circulating between the houseand the clinic, and paying little attention to anything besides his work. There was no chancefor the dreaded interview, and Clarendon did not even notice his sister’s worn-out aspectand hesitant manner.
In the evening she heard him in the library, talking to himself in a fashionmost unusual for him, and she felt that he was under a great strain which might culminate inthe return of his apathy. Entering the room, she tried to calm him without referring to anytrying subject, and forced a steadying cup of bouillon upon him. Finally she asked gently whatwas distressing him, and waited anxiously for his reply, hoping to hear that Surama’s treatmentof the poor Thibetan had horrified and outraged him.
There was a note of fretfulness in his voice as he responded.
“What’s distressing me? Good God, Georgina, what isn’t?Look at the cages and see if you have to ask again! Cleaned out—milked dry—not a cursedspecimen left; and a line of the most important bacterial cultures incubating in their tubeswithout a chance to do an ounce of good! Days’ work wasted—whole programme set back—it’senough to drive a man mad! How shall I ever get anywhere if I can’t scrape up some decentsubjects?”
Georgina stroked his forehead.
“I think you ought to rest a while, Al dear.”
He moved away.
“Rest? That’s good! That’s damn good! What else have I beendoing but resting and vegetating and staring blankly into space for the last fifty or a hundredor a thousand years? Just as I manage to shake off the clouds, I have to run short of material—andthen I’m told to lapse back again into drooling stupefaction! God! And all the while somesneaking thief is probably working with my data and getting ready to come out ahead of me withthe credit for my own work. I’ll lose by a neck—some fool with the proper specimenswill get the prize, when one week more with even half-adequate facilities would see me throughwith flying colours!”
His voice rose querulously, and there was an overtone of mental strain whichGeorgina did not like. She answered softly, yet not so softly as to hint at the soothing ofa psychopathic case.
“But you’re killing yourself with this worry and tension, and ifyou’re dead, how can you do your work?”
He gave a smile that was almost a sneer.
“I guess a week or a month—all the time I need—wouldn’tquite finish me, and it doesn’t much matter what becomes of me or any other individualin the end. Science is what must be served—science—the austere cause of human knowledge.I’m like the monkeys and birds and guinea-pigs I use—just a cog in the machine, tobe used to the advantage of the whole. They had to be killed—I may have to be killed—whatof it? Isn’t the cause we serve worth that and more?”
Georgina sighed. For a moment she wondered whether, after all, this ceaselessround of slaughter really was worth while.
“But are you absolutely sure your discovery will be enough of a boon tohumanity to warrant these sacrifices?”
Clarendon’s eyes flashed dangerously.
“Humanity! What the deuce is humanity? Science! Dolts! Just individualsover and over again! Humanity is made for preachers to whom it means the blindly credulous.Humanity is made for the predatory rich to whom it speaks in terms of dollars and cents. Humanityis made for the politician to whom it signifies collective power to be used to his advantage.What is humanity? Nothing! Thank God that crude illusion doesn’t last! What a grown manworships is truth—knowledge—science—light—the rending of the veil and thepushing back of the shadow. Knowledge, the juggernaut! There is death in our own ritual. Wemust kill—dissect—destroy—and all for the sake of discovery—the worshipof the ineffable light. The goddess Science demands it. We test a doubtful poison by killing.How else? No thought for self—just knowledge—the effect must be known.”
His voice trailed off in a kind of temporary exhaustion, and Georgina shudderedslightly.
“But this is horrible, Al! You shouldn’t think of it that way!”
Clarendon cackled sardonically, in a manner which stirred odd and repugnantassociations in his sister’s mind.
“Horrible? You think what I say is horrible? You ought to hearSurama! I tell you, things were known to the priests of Atlantis that would have you drop deadof fright if you heard a hint of them. Knowledge was knowledge a hundred thousand years ago,when our especial forbears were shambling about Asia as speechless semi-apes! They know somethingof it in the Hoggar region—there are rumours in the farther uplands of Thibet—andonce I heard an old man in China calling on Yog-Sothoth—“
He turned pale, and made a curious sign in the air with his extended forefinger.Georgina felt genuinely alarmed, but became somewhat calmer as his speech took a less fantasticform.
“Yes, it may be horrible, but it’s glorious too. The pursuit of knowledge,I mean. Certainly, there’s no slovenly sentiment connected with it. Doesn’t Naturekill—constantly and remorselessly—and are any but fools horrified at the struggle?Killings are necessary. They are the glory of science. We learn something from them, and wecan’t sacrifice learning to sentiment. Hear the sentimentalists howl against vaccination!They fear it will kill the child. Well, what if it does? How else can we discover the laws ofdisease concerned? As a scientist’s sister you ought to know better than to prate sentiment.You ought to help my work instead of hindering it!”
“But, Al,” protested Georgina, “I haven’t the slightestintention of hindering your work. Haven’t I always tried to help as much as I could? Iam ignorant, I suppose, and can’t help very actively; but at least I’m proud of you—proudfor my own sake and for the family’s sake—and I’ve always tried to smooth theway. You’ve given me credit for that many a time.”
Clarendon looked at her keenly.
“Yes,” he said jerkily as he rose and strode from the room, “you’reright. You’ve always tried to help as best you knew. You may yet have a chance to helpstill more.”
Georgina, seeing him disappear through the front door, followed him into theyard. Some distance away a lantern was shining through the trees, and as they approached itthey saw Surama bending over a large object stretched on the ground. Clarendon, advancing, gavea short grunt; but when Georgina saw what it was she rushed up with a shriek. It was Dick, thegreat St. Bernard, and he was lying still with reddened eyes and protruding tongue.
“He’s sick, Al!” she cried. “Do something for him, quick!”
The doctor looked at Surama, who had uttered something in a tongue unknownto Georgina.
“Take him to the clinic,” he ordered; “I’m afraid Dick’scaught the fever.”
Surama took up the dog as he had taken poor Tsanpo the day before, and carriedhim silently to the building near the wall. He did not chuckle this time, but glanced at Clarendonwith what appeared to be real anxiety. It almost seemed to Georgina that Surama was asking thedoctor to save her pet.
Clarendon, however, made no move to follow, but stood still for a moment andthen sauntered slowly toward the house. Georgina, astonished at such callousness, kept up arunning fire of entreaties on Dick’s behalf, but it was of no use. Without paying the slightestattention to her pleas he made directly for the library and began to read in a large old bookwhich had lain face down on the table. She put her hand on his shoulder as he sat there, buthe did not speak or turn his head. He only kept on reading, and Georgina, glancing curiouslyover his shoulder, wondered in what strange alphabet this brass-bound tome was written.
In the cavernous parlour across the hall, sitting alone in the dark a quarterof an hour later, Georgina came to her decision. Something was gravely wrong—just what,and to what extent, she scarcely dared formulate to herself—and it was time that she calledin some stronger force to help her. Of course it must be James. He was powerful and capable,and his sympathy and affection would shew him the right thing to do. He had known Al always,and would understand.
It was by this time rather late, but Georgina had resolved on action. Acrossthe hall the light still shone from the library, and she looked wistfully at the doorway asshe quietly donned a hat and left the house. Outside the gloomy mansion and forbidding grounds,it was only a short walk to Jackson Street, where by good luck she found a carriage to takeher to the Western Union telegraph office. There she carefully wrote out a message to JamesDalton in Sacramento, asking him to come at once to San Francisco on a matter of the greatestimportance to them all.

V.

Dalton was frankly perplexed by Georgina’s sudden message. He had hadno word from the Clarendons since that stormy February evening when Alfred had declared himan outsider to his home; and he in turn had studiously refrained from communicating, even whenhe had longed to express sympathy after the doctor’s summary ousting from office. He hadfought hard to frustrate the politicians and keep the appointive power, and was bitterly sorryto watch the unseating of a man who, despite recent estrangements, still represented to himthe ultimate ideal of scientific competence.
Now, with this clearly frightened summons before him, he could not imaginewhat had happened. He knew, though, that Georgina was not one to lose her head or send fortha needless alarm; hence he wasted no time, but took the Overland which left Sacramento withinthe hour, going at once to his club and sending word to Georgina by a messenger that he wasin town and wholly at her service.
Meanwhile things had been quiescent at the Clarendon home, notwithstandingthe doctor’s continued taciturnity and his absolute refusal to report on the dog’scondition. Shadows of evil seemed omnipresent and thickening, but for the moment there was alull. Georgina was relieved to get Dalton’s message and learn that he was close at hand,and sent back word that she would call him when necessity arose. Amidst all the gathering tensionsome faint compensating element seemed manifest, and Georgina finally decided that it was theabsence of the lean Thibetans, whose stealthy, sinuous ways and disturbing exotic aspect hadalways annoyed her. They had vanished all at once; and old Margarita, the sole visible servantleft in the house, told her they were helping their master and Surama at the clinic.
The following morning—the twenty-eighth of May—long to be remembered—wasdark and lowering, and Georgina felt the precarious calm wearing thin. She did not see her brotherat all, but knew he was in the clinic hard at work at something despite the lack of specimenshe had bewailed. She wondered how poor Tsanpo was getting along, and whether he had really beensubjected to any serious inoculation, but it must be confessed that she wondered more aboutDick. She longed to know whether Surama had done anything for the faithful dog amidst his master’soddly callous indifference. Surama’s apparent solicitude on the night of Dick’s seizurehad impressed her greatly, giving her perhaps the kindliest feeling she had ever had for thedetested clinic-man. Now, as the day advanced, she found herself thinking more and more of Dick;till at last her harassed nerves, finding in this one detail a sort of symbolic summation ofthe whole horror that lay upon the household, could stand the suspense no longer.
Up to that time she had always respected Alfred’s imperious wish thathe be never approached or disturbed at the clinic; but as this fateful afternoon advanced, herresolution to break through the barrier grew stronger and stronger. Finally she set out withdetermined face, crossing the yard and entering the unlocked vestibule of the forbidden structurewith the fixed intention of discovering how the dog was or of knowing the reason for her brother’ssecrecy.
The inner door, as usual, was locked; and behind it she heard voices in heatedconversation. When her knocking brought no response she rattled the knob as loudly as possible,but still the voices argued on unheeding. They belonged, of course, to Surama and her brother;and as she stood there trying to attract attention she could not help catch something of theirdrift. Fate had made her for the second time an eavesdropper, and once more the matter she overheardseemed likely to tax her mental poise and nervous endurance to their ultimate bounds. Alfredand Surama were plainly quarrelling with increasing violence, and the purport of their speechwas enough to arouse the wildest fears and confirm the gravest apprehensions. Georgina shiveredas her brother’s voice mounted shrilly to dangerous heights of fanatical tension.
“You, damn you—you’re a fine one to talk defeat and moderationto me! Who started all this, anyway? Did I have any idea of your cursed devil-gods andelder world? Did I ever in my life think of your damned spaces beyond the stars and yourcrawling chaos Nyarlathotep? I was a normal scientific man, confound you, till I was fool enoughto drag you out of the vaults with your devilish Atlantean secrets. You egged me on, and nowyou want to cut me off! You loaf around doing nothing and telling me to go slow when you mightjust as well as not be going out and getting material. You know damn well that I don’tknow how to go about such things, whereas you must have been an old hand at it before the earthwas made. It’s like you, you damned walking corpse, to start something you won’t orcan’t finish!”
Surama’s evil chuckle came.
“You’re insane, Clarendon. That’s the only reason I let yourave on when I could send you to hell in three minutes. Enough is enough, and you’ve certainlyhad enough material for any novice at your stage. You’ve had all I’m going to getyou, anyhow! You’re only a maniac on the subject now—what a cheap, crazy thing tosacrifice even your poor sister’s pet dog, when you could have spared him as well as not!You can’t look at any living thing now without wanting to jab that gold syringe into it.No—Dick had to go where the Mexican boy went—where Tsanpo and the other seven went—whereall the animals went! What a pupil! You’re no fun any more—you’ve lost your nerve.You set out to control things, and they’re controlling you. I’m about done with you,Clarendon. I thought you had the stuff in you, but you haven’t. It’s about time Itried somebody else. I’m afraid you’ll have to go!”
In the doctor’s shouted reply there was both fear and frenzy.
“Be careful, you ——! There are powers against yourpowers—I didn’t go to China for nothing, and there are things in Alhazred’sAzif which weren’t known in Atlantis! We’ve both meddled in dangerous things,but you needn’t think you know all my resources. How about the Nemesis of Flame? I talked inYemen with an old man who had come back alive from the Crimson Desert—he had seen Irem, theCity of Pillars, and had worshipped at the underground shrines of Nug and Yeb—Iä!Shub-Niggurath!”
Through Clarendon’s shrieking falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the clinic-man.
“Shut up, you fool! Do you suppose your grotesque nonsense has any weightwith me? Words and formulae—words and formulae—what do they all mean to one who hasthe substance behind them? We’re in a material sphere now, and subject to material laws.You have your fever; I have my revolver. You’ll get no specimens, and I’ll get nofever so long as I have you in front of me with this gun between!”
That was all Georgina could hear. She felt her senses reeling, and staggeredout of the vestibule for a saving breath of the lowering outside air. She saw that the crisishad come at last, and that help must now arrive quickly if her brother was to be saved fromthe unknown gulfs of madness and mystery. Summoning up all her reserve energy, she managed toreach the house and get to the library, where she scrawled a hasty note for Margarita to taketo James Dalton.
When the old woman had gone, Georgina had just strength enough to cross tothe lounge and sink weakly down into a sort of semi-stupor. There she lay for what seemed likeyears, conscious only of the fantastic creeping up of the twilight from the lower corners ofthe great, dismal room, and plagued by a thousand shadowy shapes of terror which filed withphantasmal, half-limned pageantry through her tortured and stifled brain. Dusk deepened intodarkness, and still the spell held. Then a firm tread sounded in the hall, and she heard someoneenter the room and fumble at the match-safe. Her heart almost stopped beating as the gas-jetsof the chandelier flared up one by one, but then she saw that the arrival was her brother. Relievedto the bottom of her heart that he was still alive, she gave vent to an involuntary sigh, profound,long-drawn, and tremulous, and lapsed at last into kindly oblivion.
At the sound of that sigh Clarendon turned in alarm toward the lounge, andwas inexpressibly shocked to see the pale and unconscious form of his sister there. Her facehad a death-like quality that frightened his inmost spirit, and he flung himself on his kneesby her side, awake to a realisation of what her passing away would mean to him. Long unusedto private practice amidst his ceaseless quest for truth, he had lost the physician’s instinctof first aid, and could only call out her name and chafe her wrists mechanically as fear andgrief possessed him. Then he thought of water, and ran to the dining-room for a carafe. Stumblingabout in a darkness which seemed to harbour vague terrors, he was some time in finding whathe sought; but at last he clutched it in shaking hand and hastened back to dash the cold fluidin Georgina’s face. The method was crude but effective. She stirred, sighed a second time,and finally opened her eyes.
“You are alive!” he cried, and put his cheek to hers as she strokedhis head maternally. She was almost glad she fainted, for the circumstance seemed to have dispelledthe strange Alfred and brought her own brother back to her. She sat up slowly and tried to reassurehim.
“I’m all right, Al. Just give me a glass of water. It’s a sinto waste it this way—to say nothing of spoiling my waist! Is that the way to behave everytime your sister drops off for a nap? You needn’t think I’m going to be sick, forI haven’t time for such nonsense!”
Alfred’s eyes shewed that her cool, common-sense speech had had its effect.His brotherly panic dissolved in an instant, and instead there came into his face a vague, calculatingexpression, as if some marvellous possibility had just dawned upon him. As she watched the subtlewaves of cunning and appraisal pass fleetingly over his countenance she became less and lesscertain that her mode of reassurance had been a wise one, and before he spoke she found herselfshivering at something she could not define. A keen medical instinct almost told her that hismoment of sanity had passed, and that he was now once more the unrestrained fanatic for scientificresearch. There was something morbid in the quick narrowing of his eyes at her casual mentionof good health. What was he thinking? To what unnatural extreme was his passion for experimentabout to be pushed? Wherein lay the special significance of her pure blood and absolutely flawlessorganic state? None of these misgivings, however, troubled Georgina for more than a second,and she was quite natural and unsuspicious as she felt her brother’s steady fingers ather pulse.
“You’re a bit feverish, Georgie,” he said in a precise, elaboratelyrestrained voice as he looked professionally into her eyes.
“Why, nonsense, I’m all right,” she replied. “One wouldthink you were on the watch for fever patients just for the sake of shewing off your discovery!It would be poetic, though, if you could make your final proof and demonstration by curingyour own sister!”
Clarendon started violently and guiltily. Had she suspected his wish? Had hemuttered anything aloud? He looked at her closely, and saw that she had no inkling of the truth.She smiled up sweetly into his face and patted his hand as he stood by the side of the lounge.Then he took a small oblong leather case from his vest pocket, and taking out a little goldsyringe, he began fingering it thoughtfully, pushing the piston speculatively in and out ofthe empty cylinder.
“I wonder,” he began with suave sententiousness, “whether youwould really be willing to help science in—something like that way—if the need arose?Whether you would have the devotion to offer yourself to the cause of medicine as a sort ofJephthah’s daughter if you knew it meant the absolute perfection and completion of my work?”
Georgina, catching the odd and unmistakable glitter in her brother’s eyes,knew at last that her worst fears were true. There was nothing to do now but keep him quietat all hazards and to pray that Margarita had found James Dalton at his club.
“You look tired, Al dear,” she said gently. “Why not take alittle morphia and get some of the sleep you need so badly?”
He replied with a kind of crafty deliberation.
“Yes, you’re right. I’m worn out, and so are you. Each of usneeds a good sleep. Morphine is just the thing—wait till I go and fill the syringe andwe’ll both take a proper dose.”
Still fingering the empty syringe, he walked softly out of the room. Georginalooked about her with the aimlessness of desperation, ears alert for any sign of possible help.She thought she heard Margarita again in the basement kitchen, and rose to ring the bell, inan effort to learn of the fate of her message. The old servant answered her summons at once,and declared she had given the message at the club hours ago. Governor Dalton had been out,but the clerk had promised to deliver the note at the very moment of his arrival.
Margarita waddled below stairs again, but still Clarendon did not reappear.What was he doing? What was he planning? She had heard the outer door slam, so knew he mustbe at the clinic. Had he forgotten his original intention with the vacillating mind of madness?The suspense grew almost unbearable, and Georgina had to keep her teeth clenched tightly toavoid screaming.
It was the gate bell, which rang simultaneously in house and clinic, that brokethe tension at last. She heard the cat-like tread of Surama on the walk as he left the clinicto answer it; and then, with an almost hysterical sigh of relief, she caught the firm, familiaraccents of Dalton in conversation with the sinister attendant. Rising, she almost tottered tomeet him as he loomed up in the library doorway; and for a moment no word was spoken while hekissed her hand in his courtly, old-school fashion. Then Georgina burst forth into a torrentof hurried explanation, telling all that had happened, all she had glimpsed and overheard, andall she feared and suspected.
Dalton listened gravely and comprehendingly, his first bewilderment graduallygiving place to astonishment, sympathy, and resolution. The message, held by a careless clerk,had been slightly delayed, and had found him appropriately enough in the midst of a warm lounging-roomdiscussion about Clarendon. A fellow-member, Dr. MacNeil, had brought in a medical journal withan article well calculated to disturb the devoted scientist, and Dalton had just asked to keepthe paper for future reference when the message was handed him at last. Abandoning his half-formedplan to take Dr. MacNeil into his confidence regarding Alfred, he called at once for his hatand stick, and lost not a moment in getting a cab for the Clarendon home.
Surama, he thought, appeared alarmed at recognising him; though he had chuckledas usual when striding off again toward the clinic. Dalton always recalled Surama’s strideand chuckle on this ominous night, for he was never to see the unearthly creature again. Asthe chuckler entered the clinic vestibule his deep, guttural gurgles seemed to blend with somelow mutterings of thunder which troubled the far horizon.
When Dalton had heard all Georgina had to say, and learned that Alfred wasexpected back at any moment with an hypodermic dose of morphine, he decided he had better talkwith the doctor alone. Advising Georgina to retire to her room and await developments, he walkedabout the gloomy library, scanning the shelves and listening for Clarendon’s nervous footstepon the clinic path outside. The vast room’s corners were dismal despite the chandelier,and the closer Dalton looked at his friend’s choice of books the less he liked them. Itwas not the balanced collection of a normal physician, biologist, or man of general culture.There were too many volumes on doubtful borderland themes; dark speculations and forbidden ritualsof the Middle Ages, and strange exotic mysteries in alien alphabets both known and unknown.
The great notebook of observations on the table was unwholesome, too. The handwritinghad a neurotic cast, and the spirit of the entries was far from reassuring. Long passages wereinscribed in crabbed Greek characters, and as Dalton marshalled his linguistic memory for theirtranslation he gave a sudden start, and wished his college struggles with Xenophon and Homerhad been more conscientious. There was something wrong—something hideously wrong—here,and the governor sank limply into the chair by the table as he pored more and more closely overthe doctor’s barbarous Greek. Then a sound came, startlingly near, and he jumped nervouslyat a hand laid sharply on his shoulder.
“What, may I ask, is the cause of this intrusion? You might have statedyour business to Surama.”
Clarendon was standing icily by the chair, the little gold syringe in one hand.He seemed very calm and rational, and Dalton fancied for a moment that Georgina must have exaggeratedhis condition. How, too, could a rusty scholar be absolutely sure about these Greek entries?The governor decided to be very cautious in his interview, and thanked the lucky chance whichhad placed a specious pretext in his coat pocket. He was very cool and assured as he rose toreply.
“I didn’t think you’d care to have things dragged before a subordinate,but I thought you ought to see this article at once.”
He drew forth the magazine given him by Dr. MacNeil and handed it to Clarendon.
On page 542—you see the heading, ‘Black Fever Conquered by New SerumIt’s by Dr. Miller of Philadelphia—and he thinks he’s got ahead of you with yourcure. They were discussing it at the club, and MacNeil thought the exposition very convincing.I, as a layman, couldn’t pretend to judge; but at all events I thought you oughtn’tto miss a chance to digest the thing while it’s fresh. If you’re busy, of course,I won’t disturb you—“
Clarendon cut in sharply.
“I’m going to give my sister an hypodermic—she’s not quitewell—but I’ll look at what that quack has to say when I get back. I know Miller—adamn sneak and incompetent—and I don’t believe he has the brains to steal my methodsfrom the little he’s seen of them.”
Dalton suddenly felt a wave of intuition warning him that Georgina must notreceive that intended dose. There was something sinister about it. From what she had said, Alfredmust have been inordinately long preparing it, far longer than was needed for the dissolvingof a morphine tablet. He decided to hold his host as long as possible, meanwhile testing hisattitude in a more or less subtle way.
“I’m sorry Georgina isn’t well. Are you sure that the injectionwill do her good? That it won’t do her any harm?”
Clarendon’s spasmodic start shewed that something had been struck home.
“Do her harm?” he cried. “Don’t be absurd! You know Georginamust be in the best of health—the very best, I say—in order to serve science as aClarendon should serve it. She, at least, appreciates the fact that she is my sister. She deemsno sacrifice too great in my service. She is a priestess of truth and discovery, as I am a priest.”
He paused in his shrill tirade, wild-eyed, and somewhat out of breath. Daltoncould see that his attention had been momentarily shifted.
“But let me see what this cursed quack has to say,” he continued.“If he thinks his pseudo-medical rhetoric can take a real doctor in, he is even simplerthan I thought!”
Clarendon nervously found the right page and began reading as he stood thereclutching his syringe. Dalton wondered what the real facts were. MacNeil had assured him thatthe author was a pathologist of the highest standing, and that whatever errors the article mighthave, the mind behind it was powerful, erudite, and absolutely honourable and sincere.
Watching the doctor as he read, Dalton saw the thin, bearded face grow pale.The great eyes blazed, and the pages crackled in the tenser grip of the long, lean fingers.A perspiration broke out on the high, ivory-white forehead where the hair was already thinning.and the reader sank gaspingly into the chair his visitor had vacated as he kept on with hisdevouring of the text. Then came a wild scream as from a haunted beast, and Clarendon lurchedforward on the table, his outflung arms sweeping books and paper before them as consciousnesswent dark like a wind-quenched candle-flame.
Dalton, springing to help his stricken friend, raised the slim form and tiltedit back in the chair. Seeing the carafe on the floor near the lounge, he dashed some water intothe twisted face, and was rewarded by seeing the large eyes slowly open. They were sane eyesnow—deep and sad and unmistakably sane—and Dalton felt awed in the presence of a tragedywhose ultimate depth he could never hope or dare to plumb.
The golden hypodermic was still clutched in the lean left hand, and as Clarendondrew a deep, shuddering breath he unclosed his fingers and studied the glittering thing thatrolled about on his palm. Then he spoke—slowly, and with the ineffable sadness of utter,absolute despair.
“Thanks, Jimmy, I’m quite all right. But there’s much to bedone. You asked me a while back if this shot of morphia would do Georgie any harm. I’min a position now to tell you that it won’t.”
He turned a small screw in the syringe and laid a finger on the piston, atthe same time pulling with his left hand at the skin of his own neck. Dalton cried out in alarmas a lightning motion of his right hand injected the contents of the cylinder into the ridgeof distended flesh.
“Good Lord, Al, what have you done?”
Clarendon smiled gently—a smile almost of peace and resignation, differentindeed from the sardonic sneer of the past few weeks.
“You ought to know, Jimmy, if you’ve still the judgment that madeyou a governor. You must have pieced together enough from my notes to realise that there’snothing else to do. With your marks in Greek back at Columbia I guess you couldn’t havemissed much. All I can say is that it’s true.
“James, I don’t like to pass blame along, but it’s only rightto tell you that Surama got me into this. I can’t tell you who or what he is, for I don’tfully know myself, and what I do know is stuff that no sane person ought to know; but I willsay that I don’t consider him a human being in the fullest sense, and that I’m notsure whether or not he’s alive as we know life.
“You think I’m talking nonsense. I wish I were, but the whole hideousmess is damnably real. I started out in life with a clean mind and purpose. I wanted to ridthe world of fever. I tried and failed—and I wish to God I had been honest enough to saythat I’d failed. Don’t let my old talk of science deceive you, James—I foundno antitoxin and was never even half on the track of one!
“Don’t look so shaken up, old fellow! A veteran politician-fighterlike you must have seen plenty of unmaskings before. I tell you, I never had even the startof a fever cure. But my studies had taken me into some queer places, and it was just my damnedluck to listen to the stories of some still queerer people. James, if you ever wish any manwell, tell him to keep clear of the ancient, hidden places of the earth. Old backwaters aredangerous—things are handed down there that don’t do healthy people any good. I talkedtoo much with old priests and mystics, and got to hoping I might achieve things in dark waysthat I couldn’t achieve in lawful ways.
“I shan’t tell you just what I mean, for if I did I’d be asbad as the old priests that were the ruin of me. All I need say is that after what I’velearned I shudder at the thought of the world and what it’s been through. The world iscursed old, James, and there have been whole chapters lived and closed before the dawn of ourorganic life and the geologic eras connected with it. It’s an awful thought—wholeforgotten cycles of evolution with beings and races and wisdom and diseases—all lived throughand gone before the first amoeba ever stirred in the tropic seas geology tells us about.
“I said gone, but I didn’t quite mean that. It would have been betterthat way, but it wasn’t quite so. In places traditions have kept on—I can’t tellyou how—and certain archaic life-forms have managed to struggle thinly down the aeons inhidden spots. There were cults, you know—bands of evil priests in lands now buried underthe sea. Atlantis was the hotbed. That was a terrible place. If heaven is merciful, no one willever drag up that horror from the deep.
“It had a colony, though, that didn’t sink; and when you get tooconfidential with one of the Tuareg priests in Africa, he’s likely to tell you wild talesabout it—tales that connect up with whispers you’ll hear among the mad lamas and flightyyak-drivers on the secret table-lands of Asia. I’d heard all the common tales and whisperswhen I came on the big one. What that was, you’ll never know—but it pertained to somebodyor something that had come down from a blasphemously long time ago, and could be made to liveagain—or seem alive again—through certain processes that weren’t very clear tothe man who told me.
“Now, James, in spite of my confession about the fever, you know I’mnot bad as a doctor. I plugged hard at medicine, and soaked up about as much as the next man—maybea little more, because down there in the Hoggar country I did something no priest had ever beenable to do. They led me blindfolded to a place that had been sealed up for generations—andI came back with Surama.
“Easy, James! I know what you want to say. How does he know all heknows?—why does he speak English—or any other language, for that matter—withoutan accent?—why did he come away with me?—and all that. I can’t tell youaltogether, but I can say that he takes in ideas and images and impressions with something besideshis brain and senses. He had a use for me and my science. He told me things, and opened up vistas.He taught me to worship ancient, primordial, and unholy gods, and mapped out a road to a terriblegoal which I can’t even hint to you. Don’t press me, James—it’s for thesake of your sanity and the world’s sanity!
“The creature is beyond all bounds. He’s in league with the starsand all the forces of Nature. Don’t think I’m still crazy, James—I swear to youI’m not! I’ve had too many glimpses to doubt. He gave me new pleasures that were formsof his palaeogean worship, and the greatest of those was the black fever.
“God, James! Haven’t you seen through the business by this time?Do you still believe the black fever came out of Thibet, and that I learned about it there?Use your brains, man! Look at Miller’s article here! He’s found a basic antitoxinthat will end all fever within half a century, when other men learn how to modify it for thedifferent forms. He’s cut the ground of my youth from under me—done what I’dhave given my life to do—taken the wind out of all the honest sails I ever flung to thebreeze of science! Do you wonder his article gave me a turn? Do you wonder it shocks me outof my madness back to the old dreams of my youth? Too late! Too late! But not too late to saveothers!
“I guess I’m rambling a bit now, old man. You know—the hypodermic.I asked you why you didn’t tumble to the facts about black fever. How could you, though?Doesn’t Miller say he’s cured seven cases with his serum? A matter of diagnosis, James.He only thinks it is black fever. I can read between his lines. Here, old chap, on page 551,is the key to the whole thing. Read it again.
“You see, don’t you? The fever cases from the Pacific Coastdidn’t respond to his serum. They puzzled him. They didn’t even seem like any truefever he knew. Well, those were my cases! Those were the real black fever cases!And there can’t ever be an antitoxin on earth that’ll cure black fever!
“How do I know? Because black fever isn’t of this earth! It’sfrom somewhere else, James—and Surama alone knows where, because he brought it here.He brought it and I spread it! That’s the secret, James! That’s all I wantedthe appointment for—that’s all I ever did—just spread the fever that I carriedin this gold syringe and in the deadlier finger-ring-pump-syringe you see on my index finger!Science? A blind! I wanted to kill, and kill, and kill! A single pressure on my finger, andthe black fever was inoculated. I wanted to see living things writhe and squirm, scream andfroth at the mouth. A single pressure of the pump-syringe and I could watch them as they died,and I couldn’t live or think unless I had plenty to watch. That’s why I jabbed everythingin sight with the accursed hollow needle. Animals, criminals, children, servants—and thenext would have been—“
Clarendon’s voice broke, and he crumpled up perceptibly in his chair.
“That—that, James—was—my life. Surama made it so—hetaught me, and kept me at it till I couldn’t stop. Then—then it got too much evenfor him. He tried to check me. Fancy—he trying to check anybody in that line!But now I’ve got my last specimen. That is my last test. Good subject, James—I’mhealthy—devilish healthy. Deuced ironic, though—the madness has gone now, so therewon’t be any fun watching the agony! Can’t be—can’t—“
A violent shiver of fever racked the doctor, and Dalton mourned amidst hishorror-stupefaction that he could give no grief. How much of Alfred’s story was sheer nonsense,and how much nightmare truth he could not say; but in any case he felt that the man was a victimrather than a criminal, and above all, he was a boyhood comrade and Georgina’s brother.Thoughts of the old days came back kaleidoscopically. “Little Alf”—the yard atPhillips Exeter—the quadrangle at Columbia—the fight with Tom Cortland when he savedAlf from a pommeling.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He helped Clarendon to the lounge and asked gently what he could do. Therewas nothing. Alfred could only whisper now, but he asked forgiveness for all his offences, andcommended his sister to the care of his friend.
“You—you’ll—make her happy,” he gasped. “Shedeserves it. Martyr—to—a myth! Make it up to her, James.Don’t—let—her—know—more—than she has to!”
His voice trailed off in a mumble, and he fell into a stupor. Dalton rang thebell, but Margarita had gone to bed, so he called up the stairs for Georgina. She was firm ofstep, but very pale. Alfred’s scream had tried her sorely, but she had trusted James. Shetrusted him still as he shewed her the unconscious form on the lounge and asked her to go backto her room and rest, no matter what sounds she might hear. He did not wish her to witness theawful spectacle of delirium certain to come, but bade her kiss her brother a final farewellas he lay there calm and still, very like the delicate boy he had once been. So she left him—thestrange, moonstruck, star-reading genius she had mothered so long—and the picture she carriedaway was a very merciful one.
Dalton must bear to his grave a sterner picture. His fears of delirium werenot vain, and all through the black midnight hours his giant strength restrained the frenziedcontortions of the mad sufferer. What he heard from those swollen, blackening lips he will neverrepeat. He has never been quite the same man since, and he knows that no one who hears suchthings can ever be wholly as he was before. So, for the world’s good, he dares not speak,and he thanks God that his layman’s ignorance of certain subjects makes many of the revelationscryptic and meaningless to him.
Toward morning Clarendon suddenly woke to a sane consciousness and began tospeak in a firm voice.
“James, I didn’t tell you what must be done—about everything.Blot out these entries in Greek and send my notebook to Dr. Miller. All my other notes, too,that you’ll find in the files. He’s the big authority today—his article provesit. Your friend at the club was right.
“But everything in the clinic must go. Everything without exception,dead or alive or—otherwise. All the plagues of hell are in those bottles on the shelves.Burn them—burn it all—if one thing escapes, Surama will spread black death throughoutthe world. And above all burn Surama! That—that thing—must not breathethe wholesome air of heaven. You know now—what I told you—you know why such an entitycan’t be allowed on earth. It won’t be murder—Surama isn’t human—ifyou’re as pious as you used to be, James, I shan’t have to urge you. Remember theold text—‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’—or something of the sort.
“Burn him, James! Don’t let him chuckle again over the tortureof mortal flesh! I say, burn him—the Nemesis of Flame—that’s all thatcan reach him, James, unless you can catch him asleep and drive a stake through his heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.Kill him—extirpate him—cleanse the decent universe of its primal taint—thetaint I recalled from its age-long sleep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
The doctor had risen on his elbow, and his voice was a piercing shriek towardthe last. The effort was too much, however, and he lapsed very suddenly into a deep, tranquilcoma. Dalton, himself fearless of fever, since he knew the dread germ to be non-contagious,composed Alfred’s arms and legs on the lounge and threw a light afghan over the fragileform. After all, mightn’t much of this horror be exaggeration and delirium? Mightn’told Doc MacNeil pull him through on a long chance? The governor strove to keep awake, and walkedbriskly up and down the room, but his energies had been taxed too deeply for such measures.A second’s rest in the chair by the table took matters out of his hands, and he was presentlysleeping soundly despite his best intentions.
Dalton started up as a fierce light shone in his eyes, and for a moment hethought the dawn had come. But it was not the dawn, and as he rubbed his heavy lids he saw thatit was the glare of the burning clinic in the yard, whose stout planks flamed and roared andcrackled heavenward in the most stupendous holocaust he had ever seen. It was indeed the “Nemesisof Flame” that Clarendon had wished, and Dalton felt that some strange combustibles mustbe involved in a blaze so much wilder than anything normal pine or redwood could afford. Heglanced alarmedly at the lounge, but Alfred was not there. Starting up, he went to call Georgina,but met her in the hall, roused as he was by the mountain of living fire.
“The clinic’s burning down!” she cried. “How is Al now?”
“He’s disappeared—disappeared while I dropped asleep!”replied Dalton, reaching out a steadying arm to the form which faintness had begun to sway.
Gently leading her upstairs toward her room, he promised to search at oncefor Alfred, but Georgina slowly shook her head as the flames from outside cast a weird glowthrough the window on the landing.
“He must be dead, James—he could never live, sane and knowing whathe did. I heard him quarrelling with Surama, and know that awful things were going on. He ismy brother, but—it is best as it is.”
Her voice had sunk to a whisper.
Suddenly through the open window came the sound of a deep, hideous chuckle,and the flames of the burning clinic took fresh contours till they half resembled some nameless,Cyclopean creatures of nightmare. James and Georgina paused hesitant, and peered out breathlesslythrough the landing window. Then from the sky came a thunderous peal, as a forked bolt of lightningshot down with terrible directness into the very midst of the blazing ruin. The deep chuckleceased, and in its place came a frantic, ululant yelp as of a thousand ghouls and werewolvesin torment. It died away with long, reverberant echoes, and slowly the flames resumed theirnormal shape.
The watchers did not move, but waited till the pillar of fire had shrunk toa smouldering glow. They were glad of a half-rusticity which had kept the firemen from troopingout, and of the wall that excluded the curious. What had happened was not for vulgar eyes—itinvolved too much of the universe’s inner secrets for that.
In the pale dawn, James spoke softly to Georgina, who could do no more thanput her head on his breast and sob.
“Sweetheart, I think he has atoned. He must have set the fire, you know,while I was asleep. He told me it ought to be burned—the clinic, and everything in it,Surama, too. It was the only way to save the world from the unknown horrors he had loosed uponit. He knew, and he did what was best.
“He was a great man, Georgie. Let’s never forget that. We must alwaysbe proud of him, for he started out to help mankind, and was titanic even in his sins. I’lltell you more sometime. What he did, be it good or evil, was what no man ever did before. Hewas the first and last to break through certain veils, and even Apollonius of Tyana takes secondplace beside him. But we mustn’t talk about that. We must remember him only as the LittleAlf we knew—as the boy who wanted to master medicine and conquer fever.”
In the afternoon the leisurely firemen overhauled the ruins and found two skeletonswith bits of blackened flesh adhering—only two, thanks to the undisturbed lime-pits. Onewas of a man; the other is still a subject of debate among the biologists of the coast. It wasnot exactly an ape’s or a saurian’s skeleton, but it had disturbing suggestions oflines of evolution of which palaeontology has revealed no trace. The charred skull, oddly enough,was very human, and reminded people of Surama; but the rest of the bones were beyond conjecture.Only well-cut clothing could have made such a body look like a man.
But the human bones were Clarendon’s. No one disputed this, and the worldat large still mourns the untimely death of the greatest doctor of his age; the bacteriologistwhose universal fever serum would have far eclipsed Dr. Miller’s kindred antitoxin hadhe lived to bring it to perfection. Much of Miller’s late success, indeed, is creditedto the notes bequeathed him by the hapless victim of the flames. Of the old rivalry and hatredalmost none survived, and even Dr. Wilfred Jones has been known to boast of his associationwith the vanished leader.
James Dalton and his wife Georgina have always preserved a reticence whichmodesty and family grief might well account for. They published certain notes as a tribute tothe great man’s memory, but have never confirmed or contradicted either the popular estimateor the rare hints of marvels that a very few keen thinkers have been known to whisper. It wasvery subtly and slowly that the facts filtered out. Dalton probably gave Dr. MacNeil an inklingof the truth, and that good soul had not many secrets from his son.
The Daltons have led, on the whole, a very happy life; for their cloud of terrorlies far in the background, and a strong mutual love has kept the world fresh for them. Butthere are things which disturb them oddly—little things, of which one would scarcely everthink of complaining. They cannot bear persons who are lean or deep-voiced beyond certain limits,and Georgina turns pale at the sound of any guttural chuckling. Senator Dalton has a mixed horrorof occultism, travel, hypodermics, and strange alphabets which most find hard to unify, andthere are still those who blame him for the vast proportion of the doctor’s library thathe destroyed with such painstaking completeness.
MacNeil, though, seemed to realise. He was a simple man, and he said a prayeras the last of Alfred Clarendon’s strange books crumbled to ashes. Nor would anyone whohad peered understandingly within those books wish a word of that prayer unsaid.
