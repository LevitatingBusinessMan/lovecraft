Dedicated to C. W. Smith,
from whose suggestion the central situation istaken.

There is nothing more absurd, as I view it, than that conventional association of the homelyand the wholesome which seems to pervade the psychology of the multitude. Mention a bucolicYankee setting, a bungling and thick-fibred village undertaker, and a careless mishap in a tomb,and no average reader can be brought to expect more than a hearty albeit grotesque phase ofcomedy. God knows, though, that the prosy tale which George Birch’s death permits me totell has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light.
Birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in 1881, yet never discussedthe case when he could avoid it. Neither did his old physician Dr. Davis, who died years ago.It was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip wherebyBirch had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of Peck Valley Cemetery, escapingonly by crude and disastrous mechanical means; but while this much was undoubtedly true, therewere other and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium towardthe last. He confided in me because I was his doctor, and because he probably felt the needof confiding in someone else after Davis died. He was a bachelor, wholly without relatives.
Birch, before 1881, had been the village undertaker of Peck Valley; and wasa very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go. The practices I heard attributedto him would be unbelievable today, at least in a city; and even Peck Valley would have shuddereda bit had it known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters as the ownershipof costly “laying-out” apparel invisible beneath the casket’s lid, and thedegree of dignity to be maintained in posing and adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenantsto containers not always calculated with sublimest accuracy. Most distinctly Birch was lax,insensitive, and professionally undesirable; yet I still think he was not an evil man. He wasmerely crass of fibre and function—thoughtless, careless, and liquorish, as his easilyavoidable accident proves, and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizenwithin certain limits fixed by taste.
Just where to begin Birch’s story I can hardly decide, since I am nopracticed teller of tales. I suppose one should start in the cold December of 1880, when theground froze and the cemetery delvers found they could dig no more graves till spring. Fortunatelythe village was small and the death rate low, so that it was possible to give all of Birch’sinanimate charges a temporary haven in the single antiquated receiving tomb. The undertakergrew doubly lethargic in the bitter weather, and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness.Never did he knock together flimsier and ungainlier caskets, or disregard more flagrantly theneeds of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he slammed open and shut with such nonchalantabandon.
At last the spring thaw came, and graves were laboriously prepared for thenine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb. Birch, though dreading thebother of removal and interment, began his task of transference one disagreeable April morning,but ceased before noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse, after havinglaid but one mortal tenement to its permanent rest. That was Darius Peck, the nonagenarian,whose grave was not far from the tomb. Birch decided that he would begin the next day with littleold Matthew Fenner, whose grave was also near by; but actually postponed the matter for threedays, not getting to work till Good Friday, the 15th. Being without superstition, he did notheed the day at all; though ever afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fatefulsixth day of the week. Certainly, the events of that evening greatly changed George Birch.
On the afternoon of Friday, April 15th, then, Birch set out for the tomb withhorse and wagon to transfer the body of Matthew Fenner. That he was not perfectly sober, hesubsequently admitted; though he had not then taken to the wholesale drinking by which he latertried to forget certain things. He was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his sensitivehorse, which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed and pawed and tossed its head, muchas on that former occasion when the rain had vexed it. The day was clear, but a high wind hadsprung up; and Birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron door and entered theside-hill vault. Another might not have relished the damp, odorous chamber with the eight carelesslyplaced coffins; but Birch in those days was insensitive, and was concerned only in getting theright coffin for the right grave. He had not forgotten the criticism aroused when Hannah Bixby’srelatives, wishing to transport her body to the cemetery in the city whither they had moved,found the casket of Judge Capwell beneath her headstone.
The light was dim, but Birch’s sight was good, and he did not get AsaphSawyer’s coffin by mistake, although it was very similar. He had, indeed, made that coffinfor Matthew Fenner; but had cast it aside at last as too awkward and flimsy, in a fit of curioussentimentality aroused by recalling how kindly and generous the little old man had been to himduring his bankruptcy five years before. He gave old Matt the very best his skill could produce,but was thrifty enough to save the rejected specimen, and to use it when Asaph Sawyer died ofa malignant fever. Sawyer was not a lovable man, and many stories were told of his almost inhumanvindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied. To him Birch had felt no compunctionin assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest forthe Fenner casket.
It was just as he had recognised old Matt’s coffin that the door slammedto in the wind, leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before. The narrow transom admitted onlythe feeblest of rays, and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all; so that hewas reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward thelatch. In this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles, pushed at the iron panels, andwondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant. In this twilight, too, hebegan to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neighan unsympathetic reply. For the long-neglected latch was obviously broken, leaving the carelessundertaker trapped in the vault, a victim of his own oversight.
The thing must have happened at about three-thirty in the afternoon. Birch,being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but proceeded to grope aboutfor some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb. It is doubtful whether he wastouched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position, but the bald fact of imprisonmentso far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly. His day’swork was sadly interrupted, and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither, he mighthave to remain all night or longer. The pile of tools soon reached, and a hammer and chiselselected, Birch returned over the coffins to the door. The air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome;but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled, half by feeling, at the heavy and corrodedmetal of the latch. He would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle; but lacking these,bungled semi-sightlessly as best he might.
When he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding, at least to suchmeagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these, Birch glanced about for other possiblepoints of escape. The vault had been dug from a hillside, so that the narrow ventilation funnelin the top ran through several feet of earth, making this direction utterly useless to consider.Over the door, however, the high, slit-like transom in the brick facade gave promise of possibleenlargement to a diligent worker; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brainsfor means to reach it. There was nothing like a ladder in the tomb, and the coffin niches onthe sides and rear—which Birch seldom took the trouble to use—afforded no ascentto the space above the door. Only the coffins themselves remained as potential stepping-stones,and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of arranging them. Three coffin-heights,he reckoned, would permit him to reach the transom; but he could do better with four. The boxeswere fairly even, and could be piled up like blocks; so he began to compute how he might moststably use the eight to rear a scalable platform four deep. As he planned, he could not butwish that the units of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made. Whether he hadimagination enough to wish they were empty, is strongly to be doubted.
Finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall, to placeupon this two layers of two each, and upon these a single box to serve as the platform. Thisarrangement could be ascended with a minimum of awkwardness, and would furnish the desired height.Better still, though, he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support the superstructure,leaving one free to be piled on top in case the actual feat of escape required an even greateraltitude. And so the prisoner toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortalitywith little ceremony as his miniature Tower of Babel rose course by course. Several of the coffinsbegan to split under the stress of handling, and he planned to save the stoutly built casketof little Matthew Fenner for the top, in order that his feet might have as certain a surfaceas possible. In the semi-gloom he trusted mostly to touch to select the right one, and indeedcame upon it almost by accident, since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd volitionafter he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third layer.
The tower at length finished, and his aching arms rested by a pause duringwhich he sat on the bottom step of his grim device, Birch cautiously ascended with his toolsand stood abreast of the narrow transom. The borders of the space were entirely of brick, andthere seemed little doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to allow his body topass. As his hammer blows began to fall, the horse outside whinnied in a tone which may havebeen encouraging and may have been mocking. In either case it would have been appropriate; forthe unexpected tenacity of the easy-looking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on thevanity of mortal hopes, and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus.
Dusk fell and found Birch still toiling. He worked largely by feeling now,since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt heartenedat the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture. He could, he was sure,get out by midnight—though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untingedwith eerie implications. Undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time, the place, and thecompany beneath his feet, he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing whena fragment hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horsethat pawed near the cypress tree. In time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try hisbody in it now and then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked.He would not, he found, have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height; forthe hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit.
It must have been midnight at least when Birch decided he could get throughthe transom. Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he descended to the floor and sat a whileon the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside. Thehungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily, and he vaguely wished it would stop.He was curiously unelated over his impending escape, and almost dreaded the exertion, for hisform had the indolent stoutness of early middle age. As he remounted the splitting coffins hefelt his weight very poignantly; especially when, upon reaching the topmost one, he heard thataggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood. He had, it seems, planned invain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform; for no sooner was his full bulk againupon it than the rotting lid gave way, jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even hedid not care to imagine. Maddened by the sound, or by the stench which billowed forth even tothe open air, the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh, and plungedmadly off through the night, the wagon rattling crazily behind it.
Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble out ofthe enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined try. Clutching the edges ofthe aperture, he sought to pull himself up, when he noticed a queer retardation in the formof an apparent drag on both his ankles. In another moment he knew fear for the first time thatnight; for struggle as he would, he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held hisfeet in relentless captivity. Horrible pains, as of savage wounds, shot through his calves;and in his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggestedsplinters, loose nails, or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box. Perhaps he screamed.At any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness wasalmost eclipsed in a half-swoon.
Instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom, and in the crawl whichfollowed his jarring thud on the damp ground. He could not walk, it appeared, and the emergingmoon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemeterylodge; his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste, and his body responding withthat maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare. Therewas evidently, however, no pursuer; for he was alone and alive when Armington, the lodge-keeper,answered his feeble clawing at the door.
Armington helped Birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little sonEdwin for Dr. Davis. The afflicted man was fully conscious, but would say nothing of any consequence;merely muttering such things as “oh, my ankles!”, “let go!”, or “shutin the tomb”. Then the doctor came with his medicine-case and asked crisp questions, andremoved the patient’s outer clothing, shoes, and socks. The wounds—for both ankleswere frightfully lacerated about the Achilles’ tendons—seemed to puzzle the oldphysician greatly, and finally almost to frighten him. His questioning grew more than medicallytense, and his hands shook as he dressed the mangled members; binding them as if he wished toget the wounds out of sight as quickly as possible.
For an impersonal doctor, Davis’ ominous and awestruck cross-examinationbecame very strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker every least detailof his horrible experience. He was oddly anxious to know if Birch were sure—absolutelysure—of the identity of that top coffin of the pile; how he had chosen it, how he hadbeen certain of it as the Fenner coffin in the dusk, and how he had distinguished it from theinferior duplicate coffin of vicious Asaph Sawyer. Would the firm Fenner casket have caved inso readily? Davis, an old-time village practitioner, had of course seen both at the respectivefunerals, as indeed he had attended both Fenner and Sawyer in their last illnesses. He had evenwondered, at Sawyer’s funeral, how the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight ina box so closely akin to that of the diminutive Fenner.
After a full two hours Dr. Davis left, urging Birch to insist at all timesthat his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood. What else, he added,could ever in any case be proved or believed? But it would be well to say as little as couldbe said, and to let no other doctor treat the wounds. Birch heeded this advice all the restof his life till he told me his story; and when I saw the scars—ancient and whitened asthey then were—I agreed that he was wise in so doing. He always remained lame, for thegreat tendons had been severed; but I think the greatest lameness was in his soul. His thinkingprocesses, once so phlegmatic and logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitifulto note his response to certain chance allusions such as “Friday”, “tomb”,“coffin”, and words of less obvious concatenation. His frightened horse had gonehome, but his frightened wits never quite did that. He changed his business, but something alwayspreyed upon him. It may have been just fear, and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belatedsort of remorse for bygone crudities. His drinking, of course, only aggravated what it was meantto alleviate.
When Dr. Davis left Birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to theold receiving tomb. The moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and marred facade,and the latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the outside. Steeled by oldordeals in dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and looked about, stifling the nausea of mindand body that everything in sight and smell induced. He cried aloud once, and a little latergave a gasp that was more terrible than a cry. Then he fled back to the lodge and broke allthe rules of his calling by rousing and shaking his patient, and hurling at him a successionof shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriol.
“It was Asaph’s coffin, Birch, just as I thought! I knew his teeth,with the front ones missing on the upper jaw—never, for God’s sake, shew those wounds!The body was pretty badly gone, but if ever I saw vindictiveness on any face—or formerface.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know what a fiend he was for revenge—how he ruined oldRaymond thirty years after their boundary suit, and how he stepped on the puppy that snappedat him a year ago last August.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was the devil incarnate, Birch, and I believehis eye-for-an-eye fury could beat old Father Death himself. God, what a rage! I’d hateto have it aimed at me!
“Why did you do it, Birch? He was a scoundrel, and I don’t blameyou for giving him a cast-aside coffin, but you always did go too damned far! Well enough toskimp on the thing some way, but you knew what a little man old Fenner was.
“I’ll never get the picture out of my head as long as I live. Youkicked hard, for Asaph’s coffin was on the floor. His head was broken in, and everythingwas tumbled about. I’ve seen sights before, but there was one thing too much here. Aneye for an eye! Great heavens, Birch, but you got what you deserved. The skull turned my stomach,but the other was worse—those ankles cut neatly off to fit Matt Fenner’s cast-asidecoffin!”
